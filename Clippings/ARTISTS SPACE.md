Our name “Artists Space” distills our mission into its most essential form with a limitlessness which has proven supremely generative. Our early logo was simply a blank square with a large “A” emblazoned on it, a diagram that is both utterly simple and endlessly complex. Which artists? What space? What public? Our cultural stakes are particularly volatile at this moment, and how these questions are framed and answered is an important responsibility and one that Artists Space has been unwaveringly committed to throughout its 50 year history.
