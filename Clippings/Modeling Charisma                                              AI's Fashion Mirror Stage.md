AI is in fashion, making it the object of human admiration and resentment.1 As a trendy technology, AI is doing what fashion has done for several centuries: repeating and projecting our mis-identifications back to us, like a monstrous twin. Through artificial neural networks (ANNs) that process natural language into tokens and images into feature vectors, deep-learning models study patterns in their training sets in order to generate texts and images that are “almost the same, but not quite.”2 Colonizing the territory of human imagination, generative AI rehearses our traumas (“our” being the complex human cultural forms that exist as “data dumps” on the Internet).3 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) mimic in order to produce something “new” within the distribution of the provided data set. Or rather, these machines replicate in *mean*\-median form (as Hito Steyerl might put it) what their companies have stolen.4  

It is little wonder that much of the popular discourse about AI over the past two-to-three years has focused on the disorientation borne out of our traumatic encounter with these machines. As the anxious founders of The Center for Humane Technology framed it in March 2023: “because it’s happening so quickly, it’s hard to perceive it. Paradigmatically, this whole space sits in our cognitive blind spot.”5 They bemoan t
