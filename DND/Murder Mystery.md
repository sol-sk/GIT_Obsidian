*Rolling perception on room (15)*
- Ostrich and friars by bar–bartender is ignoring ostrich as he tries to order drink
- Well dressed male arctic fox, w/ rubies and amber woven into his suit

*Perception on Lady Findebear (20)*
- Learning on Yasha's chair, clutching it like she can't stand, he offers her chair 
- Hair teased, sliding around; you can see her hair is thinning
- looks way worse than last time
- sickly skinny
- hands shaking 
- in conversation; looks like her attention is jumping around room, can't focus on Yasha
- Sweating through very heavy makeup, also looks shivering
- Tongue wagging uncontrollably, slurring
- Bloody cough into handkerchief

> [!info] Oliver Shout
> - Famous in the paper
> - Bumbling vigilante/PI
> - Hated by police bc of his shit

Findebear and Yasha go out door into main hall; I follow super stealthily

#### Entrance
Severil has pinned Ike to the wall angrily
Yasha says "this is a close friend to me and you will treat him with respect"
Severil drops Ike
- Severil: "if he dies on these grounds i will be the one who killed him"

Hedge is now overgrown over the driveway we entered through 

*Perception on Ike (17)*
- Haven't seen him in a year
- Still well dressed young man, like I remember
- Appearance is quite different to what it used to be; effeminate in a "guy reading poetry" way 
	- Fancier, more intricate garments
- Face looks quite different; would be difficult to recognize if I didn't know him quite well

Yasha catches me as i try to get back in (-2 bludgeoning); i try to distract, say hello to Ike, who says he doesn't recognize me, name is Dr. James OMuyerl ??

Get back inside

#### Main dining room
Art deco Badger woman moves her place setting to end of the table, pockets other name card
Young male badger (servant) rushes behind the bar and out the door

Leonard is seated at the end of the table furthest from the door, next to James (spider)
- I ask "come here often" and he sayd are you hitting on me and i say no and he says i woul dhave told you if you were... no, i've never been here before (we wink)

*Perception on dining room (21)*
Tablecloth is charred at my table; *investigation (17)*

> 7:20: fire put out

Beaver woman
*Insight on her; (1)*
- Who knows!
- (other insight check: she came in through a diff entrace, which you would need Findebear's room key for)

*Insight on Molly (19+1)*
- She takes over for Joanna, who leaves when everyone had stepped out for the fire to be put out
- She seems very comfortable taking over, and it seems the fire was not the primary reason for Joanna to leave

**Talking to James**
- Molly and Joanna known each other for a long time, been preparing for a while
