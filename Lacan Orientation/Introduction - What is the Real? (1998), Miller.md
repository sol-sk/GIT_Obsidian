> Imaginary Real Symbolic (IRS) lol


Symptom will always resist meaning, does not have meaning, is assigned meaning by us 

Being forced to wait for something; experience of frustration is both real and signified 

Divertance between Real of person detouring (and who thus fears making someone wait)–and Real of person waiting (and experiences the frustration)

Function of time and what is real in time – function being what time does; that is what is real 

Lack of control on both sides; for those waiting and for his being forced to detour by the police – asymmetry ?
{Law courts; the waiting until the Signifier–judge–arrives, whose presence is a command (stand), and who gives permission (sit)}

→ Etiquette
The thing and the "should be"
*Should be* = ideal 

**Analysis begins with the goal of ideal but in order to practice one must let go**

**Ideal/symbolic?** 
- Relation of ideal to rest of tripartite; ideal in imaginary
- Ego/ideal 
- Imaginary/symbolic

Infancy - begins in real (but in "body event" different)

> There is a dependence in the symptom in respect t to the ideal, and because of that Lacan makes of it a phenomenon of belief. As a result, to believe you have a symptom, as something that does not function well, there has to be an idea of how it should be functioning, that is, a representation of the ideal. And the weight of the ideal measures exactly the non-identification with ~ the symptom

Ideal remains until the end
Body-event 

Real cannot exist without ideal/should-be

Intro–being at his destination is the ideal, the time being Real 

My Q; how do we know wha tto call "Real?"
- It's something tat's in the peripheral, it's paradowical, can/'t be identified, recognized – can be felt
- *The real finds you*

A's: 

> To my understanding, Lacan establishes in his last teaching that where the analyst searches for the truth, the *matheme* conduces him to find the real, and that the *deception of the truth* is correlated to an access to the real, where it is certainly less about him finding the real than the real finding him

[[1_JAM_What is the Real_LI 43_44.pdf#page=5&selection=96,0,100,46|1_JAM_What is the Real_LI 43_44, page 5]]

Not seeking real, seeking truth – have an ideal that is in one's mind, which you think is the truth, which is real

The deception in the notion of the truth/the truth lies – realizing this deception is the access to the real?; The real in analysis through the lying truth

Connors q– carryover between Adorno and Lacan
- Non-identity
- Articulating somehting about the real through language but understanding that language is nonidentical to what you "attempt to signify"
- When addressing the real through language negotiating that gap

**Etiquette-Protocol/First Matheme/Second Matheme**
> I asked myself where the term etiquette came from, which prompted me to find out that J would have to look into the Dutch root. ,1ik/..e1111,which designates a fishing rod planted in earth, and, from there, a net tied to it to catch fi:,,h.It's about fishing, and there arc. as it says in the Bible, fishers of men. Who knows by which channels thi:, word transformed to that of the label that is placed on a cabinet which contains the Ii les of a judicial process. Then- with this we arc approaching it-it became the mark which indi- cates rank in order of precedence. So the etiquette. with a defined artide. arrived at designating this very order, the set of etiquettes that assigns each one to his place, and with this, their role.

Relationship between analyst/analysand, analytic situation

> It also seems to me that Lacan transitioned from the ethic in psychoanalysis to its etiquette, that what he calls discourse is an etiquette, an order of precedence which indicates what is first and what is second. The discourse, according to Lacan, is a m

chine that assigns places, something which explains the relationship that is established between this and the art of dance. He defines, then, dance as an art which flourishes when various discourses occupy its places.
> Indeed, today we find that the success of hip-hop in the suburbs is an attempt to remedy the fact that discourses do not settle into their place well.

Connor: "remedy"--??? seems like anything but

Hip hop providing vehicle for recognizing/challenging lack of settlement– demonstrating the fact that the etiquette's precedence is not settling fully 

"Suburbs" here is actually referring to the "outer boroughs" in context of Paris, that is the Parisian Bronx, Harlem

Q: is etiquette a big Other?
As:
- Etiquette is discourse/machine 
	- Set of rules over how people behave
Lacan systematizing discourse through "mathemes"
JAM - connecting ethics 
- Ethics as way of doing
- Slightly removed from the "wagging finger" of superego

- Lacan's permutations of Freudian terms -- Name of the Father relating to superego 

Eti/Ethiquette in particular function of time
Following regimented, step by step, Vs mixing up of that time
Dance: difference between etiquette which describes rules of ceremony and dance which is overlapping of discourses

Discussion of time begins: 
> Ethics-like etiquette-is a discourse that intends to say what should precede and what should follow.

[[1_JAM_What is the Real_LI 43_44.pdf#page=3&selection=6,56,6,62|1_JAM_What is the Real_LI 43_44, page 3]]

You need ethics when you don't know what your etiquette is 
Etiquette as discourse -- or, ? 
> PROTOCOL 
> This discourse, this etiquette was imposed-in any case, was born- when the discourses proved unable to situate themselves very well in the era that Eric Laurent and I dubbed *the Other which does not exist*. Likewise, the era in which the only "discourse" that occupies its place is that of"science" (I put it in quotation marks because it is an anti-discourse, capable of dismissing all the others)

[[1_JAM_What is the Real_LI 43_44.pdf#page=3&selection=49,0,76,56|1_JAM_What is the Real_LI 43_44, page 3]]

Etiquette is breaking down because the Other does not exist (?)

> *Lacan tried to relate analytical discourse with scientific discourse, reconcile it with the antidiscourse, moving it away from the order of ceremony,* which precisely ridicules what can be of the order of the real. And to reconcile psychoanalysis with the scientific discourse means that its specific manipulation of the semblance would constitute a protocol that would give access to a real

Like science, etiquette is mobile

Modes of assigning without going into Ideal ?
Analytic discourse is the only discourse which does not dominate; functionalize/formalize etiquette in order to keep it working?

> This is the natural consequence of having established a causal relationship between the signifier and signified, to having made the signifier the cause of the effects that populate the domain of the signified. It is the consequence of its construction-which takes from Jakobson and transforms it over the metaphor and metonymy, which, translated in terms of the real, simply means that the psychoanalytic real is the signifier. The development of this notion occupies the central, classic message of Lacan 's teach- ings, by which the unconscious is not history but knowledge, what assigns the real indicator to the signifier. There, in the most self- evident way, the marriage between psychoanalysis and science is celebrated-it is as if the unconscious gives evidence that there is knowledge in the real. that the real presents itself in the form of knowledge.

> For this reason Lacan hinted that what he was searching for was located, these are his words, "beyond the unconscious," according to his firsl lesson in his seminar titled L'insu que sait de l'une-bevue s'aile a mourre. It is the search of a notion, a concept, a movement, a vector that would go beyond the unconscious. Furthermore, this supposedly submits truth to the discus- sion-the analytic experience itself as a search for truth. Indeed, from whatever angle one addresses it, the

- T'ai describes this view as the hermeneutic view rather than all spectators - hysterical component
