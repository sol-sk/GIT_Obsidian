Symptom will always resist meaning, does not have meaning, is assigned meaning by us 

Being forced to wait for something; experience of frustration is both real and signified 

Divertance between Real of person detouring (and who thus fears making someone wait)–and Real of person waiting (and experiences the frustration)

Function of time and what is real in time – function being what time does; that is what is real 

Lack of control on both sides; for those waiting and for his being forced to detour by the police – asymmetry ?
{Law courts; the waiting until the Signifier–judge–arrives, whose presence is a command (stand), and who gives permission (sit)}

→ Etiquette
The thing and the "should be"
*Should be* = ideal 

**Analysis begins with the goal of ideal but in order to practice one must let go**

**Ideal/symbolic?** 
- Relation of ideal to rest of tripartite; ideal in imaginary
- Ego/ideal 
- Imaginary/symbolic

Infancy - begins in real (but in "body event" different)

> There is a dependence in the symptom in respect t to the ideal, and because of that Lacan makes of it a phenomenon of belief. As a result, to believe you have a symptom, as something that does not function well, there has to be an idea of how it should be functioning, that is, a representation of the ideal. And the weight of the ideal measures exactly the non-identification with ~ the symptom

Ideal remains until the end
Body-event 

Real cannot exist without ideal/should-be
