Nam June Paik (July 1932 – January 2006)

> *“Once recorded on videotape, you are no longer free to die,”*

Nam June Paik, born in South Korea, was a Korean multimedia artist. He went on to live across Germany, the USA and Japan and has been branded the ‘father of video art’.

> *“I want to shape the TV screen canvas as precisely as* [*Leonardo*](http://www.artnet.com/artists/leonardo-da-vinci/)*, as freely as* [*Picasso*](http://www.artnet.com/artists/pablo-picasso/)*, as colorfully as* [*Renoir*](http://www.artnet.com/artists/pierre-auguste-renoir/)*, as profoundly as* [*Mondrian*](http://www.artnet.com/artists/piet-mondrian/)*, as violently as* [*Pollock*](http://www.artnet.com/artists/jackson-pollock/)*, and as lyrically as* [*Jasper Johns*](http://www.artnet.com/artists/jasper-johns/)*”*

Paik worked at the intersection of art, installation, performance and technology.

> *“Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality. Technology has become the body’s new membrane of existence.”*

In 1957, Paik attended the International Summer Courses for New Music in Darmstadt when he met Karlheinz Stockhausen and again in 1958 when he met John Cage, the latter of whom had a great influence on Paik. In [*Hommage à John Cage* (1959)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSREMldyFtg&ab_channel=hattn), Paik used a combination of audiotape and performance to challenge traditional musical instrumentation and composition.

In 1962, Paik took part in the Fluxus International Festival of the New Music in Wiesbaden.

In 1974, he coined the phrase ‘electronic superhighway’, foreseeing the future of communication in the age of the internet. Paik also used more ‘traditional’ mediums for his art including paintings and drawings.
