1) In §5.4 of his Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on physicalism, Daniel Stoljar describes a methodological criticism of physicalism that he finds in Noam Chomsky. Explain and briefly assess this Chomskyan criticism, as Stoljar explains it. You may find it helpful to connect Chomsky’s methodological criticisms to the considerations that Barbara Montero raises.

  

Either the dualist project is true, in which case there is an assumption that science of observable physics/concretely existing objects will never truly explain the mind, or, the physicalist project is true, in which case the mind is nothing more than the sum of its physical parts. In either case, the argument arrives at a largely uninteresting conclusion regarding the continued study or philosophy of consciousness.

 Stoljar summarizes Chomsky’s argument as being against the physicalist project–that it is either misleading or illegitimate. Physicalism is misleading because it purports to be distinct from the natural sciences, yet physicalists accept methodological naturalism and the resulting scientific discoveries. If the physicalist project is not scientific in nature, and the naturalistic (i.e., scientific) project is not philosophical in nature, problems arise. 

For the sake of simplicity, in this section I am going to refer to Stoljar’s paraphrasing of Chomsky as just “Chomsky.” However, as I will address later, Stoljar leaves out some core components of Chomsky’s argument. From the standpoint of naturalists, the investigation into “the mental” (Chomsky’s general term for consciousness, cognition, or anything else typically relating to the mind, without entailing a metaphysical divide) should be pursued by the same methods as the rest of the sciences–this approach being methodological naturalism. Because the rational approach to understanding the world is that of methodological naturalism, it follows that it is rational to pursue an understanding of consciousness through the same means. Chomsky’s second point is that the physicalist project differs significantly from the naturalistic project. The naturalistic project is not in the realm of metaphysics–which the physicalist project often is–although it does continue to push the boundaries of what aspects of the mental science can hope to explain. Nor is naturalism particularly entwined with philosophy, while physicalism is “central to analytic philosophy.” 

Chomsky’s criticism is regarding the split between the physicalist project and the naturalistic project. First, that the physicalist project is ill-defined, and second, that despite being separate from naturalists, physicalists “endorse methodological naturalism.” So, if there is no real distinction between the two, it would be misleading to consider physicalism in the realm of metaphysics and philosophy rather than science. Thus, the dilemma: if physicalism is identical to naturalism, then we have misconstrued it entirely, and if it is not, it is illegitimate. 

I believe Chomsky (via Stoljar) presents a reasonable argument against physicalism and for methodological naturalism, whether or not it closes the door to the physicalist project entirely. I accept that methodological naturalism regarding the study of consciousness is rational. I also agree that the physicalist project is ill-defined, both in its ultimate goal (which Stoljar does go on to define) and in its distinction from the natural sciences. I will investigate more closely the second criticism Chomsky makes, as presented by Stoljar: “Second, it is hard to see how this sort of project could recommend itself to physicalists themselves — such a project seems to be a departure from methodological naturalism but most physicalists endorse methodological naturalism as a matter of fact.” 

  

Stoljar’s response to Chomsky is that the physicalist project is concerned with the limits of the naturalistic project with respect to consciousness. However, it isn’t necessary to exclude the natural sciences outright from philosophical considerations in order to have meaningful debate or discussion. Stoljar says naturalistic project won’t succeed bc qualia inaccessible by naturalistic but why not just talk about the nature of qualia??  

  

I believe that Stoljar presents Chomsky’s argument as weaker than it is. 

> In sum, Chomsky’s criticism is best understood as a kind of dilemma. The physicalist project is either identical to the naturalistic project or it is not. If it is identical, then the language and concepts that shape the project are potentially extremely misleading; but if it is not identical, then there are a number of ways in which it is illegitimate.

I believe there are several components Stoljar did not include that are worth considering to fully address his argument. First, Stoljar begins his counterargument by bringing up Thomas Nagel, but does not mention that Chomsky spends a considerable amount of time with Nagel’s ideas. I will not delve fully into Nagel’s argument against physicalism–I will just note that he defines the mental in terms of consciousness, and the physical as “that which can be described in nonmental terms.” (87) It is not entirely fair to base portions of my argument on neuroscience research which did not exist in 2000 or 2001, when Stoljar and Chomsky were writing these papers, which was already nearly a decade after Nagel. However, when Nagel identifies consciousness as the defining characteristic of mental phenomena, which can not be reduced to physical terms, it provides an opportunity to not only confirm Chomsky’s point but as a basis for further discussion of Hempel’s dilemma. Now, we are able to reconstruct from brain imaging (which captures the physical and nothing more) a person’s mental content. 

Consider Nagel’s notions “capable of description by physical science” and “described by physics.” What do they mean? [...] True, a branch of science not then unified with physics could provide much illumination in terms of its own theoretical constructs, as of much else; but the same is true today of some of the domain of the mental (in my sense). Why are these accounts less “physical” than chemistry was a century ago? (88)

Hempel’s dilemma here can be applied in an equivalent way to neuroscience. Contemporary neuroscience and psychology are incomplete; how could we base an argument on a theoretically complete future neuroscience? The argument for methodological naturalism here is clear: why try to arrive at a conclusion which is ultimately baseless or unverifiable when you could instead pursue productive, descriptive, experimental methods, which will result in a stronger foundation for future researchers to reliably build upon (here we could come to the replication crisis, but I’m not taking ownership for the fault of the industry).
