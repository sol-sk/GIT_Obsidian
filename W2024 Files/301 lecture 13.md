green = excitation, glutamate
red = inhib, GABA

spontaneous behavior is pretty low bc default condition/baseline is for thalamus, and therefore cortex, to be inhibited
- GPi releasing lots of GABA to thal
- GPi main output region from basal gang
	- To move; lower GABA 
- More APs in striatum = more GABA to GPi = Less GABA to thal 
-
