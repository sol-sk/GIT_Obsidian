green = excitation, glutamate
red = inhib, GABA

spontaneous behavior is pretty low bc default condition/baseline is for thalamus, and therefore cortex, to be inhibited
- GPi releasing lots of GABA to thal
- GPi main output region from basal gang
	- To move; lower GABA 
- 
Direct/Go path
- More APs in striatum D1R = more GABA to GPi = Less GABA to thal = more stim to motor cortices

Indirect/stop pathway 
- GPe increases inhibition !!!
- GPe inhibited by striatum → not firing APs to release GABA to GPi → not inhibiting subthal nuc. or GPi → subthal stimulates GPi
