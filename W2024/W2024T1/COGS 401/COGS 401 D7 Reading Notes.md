### Optimality Theory 

What are the "rules" that we follow when we say words out loud? Looking at a written word, there are things that we change about the literal way that it's written when we say it: these changes can be tracked systematically and described as "constraints" that we follow: What we say should be as close as possible to the way it's written, for instance, but it also shouldn't have sounds that are difficult or unnatural feeling, like too many consonants in a row at the beginning or end of a word. Some of these constraints, or rules on pronouncing words, are more important than others; we can rank them in order to generate a reliable way of ensuring that the pronunciation is as optimal as possible (as in, can be pronounced easily while still being faithful to the written version)

In actuality, the "written" version as I've called it is actually an "underlying representation." The textbook describes this as the way it's represented in our "mental lexicon." Because the spoken version of a word is the "surface representation," I think of the "underlying" representation as all non-spoken versions of a word, like how we think of it and how it's written.

A key part of optimality theory is that it is not specific to a single language: these constraints are actually innate. Therefore, we have to look across the world at what sorts of patterns we see in how words are said to find what rules are (near)-universal and therefore likely due to rules/constraints that we all know innately. 

Children are helpful in understanding innate rules because we can see across different languages how easy versus difficult some pronunciations are (if they are favored or not), or the common patterns in how words are changed from their "adult" (correct) versions. For instance, because children at a very young age tend not to include the last consonant in a word, like changing "bad" to "ba", we could infer that there is an innate preference for pronunciations that end with vowels instead of consonants. 

If following one constraint makes it impossible to follow other constraints, we should change the "ranking" to prioritize it less because it makes it less optimal. 

**3.2 Syllable shape inventories**

Chart notation: 
* Violation mark = *
- Filtered out losing candidate = !
> The exclamation points in this tableau are a standard way of highlighting why each suboptimal candidate lost out to the optimal one – that is they show which constraint filtered out that row’s losing candidate, in favour of the winning optimal one. Notice that the ordering of the rows in a tableau is arbitrary: each one simply lists a potential candidate and its violations.

*Designing the optimal phonological grammar*

Children’s syllables lack r, s, w, final consonants (l, t pronounced but not at end of word) across all languages studied (Eu Portuguese, Qu French, Am English)
- Consonant-Vowel syllable shape 
Some languages are CV/CVV only; Cayuvava, Hawaiian, Hua: but the inverse, VC, is much less common, and no languages are exclusively VC. 
	→ indicates that "optimal grammar" 

Child grammar is not exclusively CV, can also be CV(C): “somewhat optimal” example table 5, compare to Yakuts (6) which is also CV(C)
-> Grammar must “make reference to all the pieces of an optimal syllable” (56)

OT constraints: descriptions of output properties, enforced to varying degrees 
- NoComplexOnset: no onset contains more than one segment 
- NoCoda: no syllable contains a coda 
- NoComplexCoda: no coda contains more than one segment 
- Onset: no syllable lacks an onset
→ CV the only syllable structure that satisfies all of these

Spanish, Canto both follow NoComplexCoda

Depending on language, children will acquire more complex syllable structures (CCVC, CCV, VCC, etc.) in different orders

>  Syllable structure typology is fairly well understood across the world’s languages, so the comparisons between child and adult patterns are plausibly accurate. Thus, children’s stages of syllable structure provide an excellent empirical area in which to build our theory of developing phonological grammars [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=10&selection=4,0,7,65|p.10]]

**3.3 Optimizing syllable shapes**
*Deletion*
How to follow NoCoda? Delete coda

Following all 4 constraints, how will we have enough forms to make a whole language? 
> So a constraint-based phonological grammar is built to do two things: first to filter out disprefered output structures, but second to **maintain the material that’s stored in underlying representations**. This is accomplished via a second set of constraints, which each require that properties of the input be faithfully reproduced in the output [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=12&selection=131,0,135,34|p.12]]

“Faithfulness constraints”
- Max (aka Don‘tDelete): input should be maximally preserved 

*How are constraints ranked?*

***How do we conform to constraints?***
- Deletion
- *Epenthesis*: Inserting new segments
	- New faithfulness constraint: 
	- Dep (Don’t epenthesize)

Ranking constraints: Dep must be lowest because we can conform to both other constraints as long as Dep is violated [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=17&selection=128,1,128,3|p17]]

Hebrew children example
- obstruent-obstruent clusters permitted
- Position in cluster: *closest to vowel survives*, not just sonority ranking
	- Contiguity (faithfulness constraint) 

> The additional tool that we will use to capture this ordering fact is a **faithfulness constraint**, proposed in the OT literature to explain other target language patterns, which prefers output strings to be contiguous in the input. This constraint (simply called CONTIGUITY) always prefers $/C_1C_2V/ \rightarrow [C_2V]$ in every case, simply because the alternative $[C_1V]$ involves two segments which are contiguous in the output but not the input. [[Tessier2015_Chapter3-1.pdf#page=29&selection=119,0,143,53|page 29]]

Individual variability
