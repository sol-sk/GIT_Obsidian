### Optimality Theory 

What are the "rules" that we follow when we say words out loud? Looking at a written word, there are things that we change about the literal way that it's written when we say it: these changes can be tracked systematically and described as "constraints" that we follow: What we say should be as close as possible to the way it's written, for instance, but it also shouldn't have sounds that are difficult or unnatural feeling, like too many consonants in a row at the beginning or end of a word. Some of these constraints, or rules on pronouncing words, are more important than others; we can rank them in order to generate a reliable way of ensuring that the pronunciation is as optimal as possible (as in, can be pronounced easily while still being faithful to the written version)

In actuality, the "written" version as I've called it is actually an "underlying representation." The textbook describes this as the way it's represented in our "mental lexicon." Because the spoken version of a word is the "surface representation," I think of the "underlying" representation as all non-spoken versions of a word, like how we think of it and how it's written.

A key part of optimality theory is that it is not specific to a single language: these constraints are actually innate. Therefore, we have to look across the world at what sorts of patterns we see in how words are said to find what rules are (near)-universal and therefore likely due to rules/constraints that we all know innately. 

Children are helpful in understanding innate rules because we can see across different languages how easy versus difficult some pronunciations are (if they are favored or not), or the common patterns in how words are changed from their "adult" (correct) versions. For instance, because children at a very young age tend not to include the last consonant in a word, like changing "bad" to "ba", we could infer that there is an innate preference for pronunciations that end with vowels instead of consonants. 

If following one constraint makes it impossible to follow other constraints, we should change the "ranking" to prioritize it less because it makes it less optimal. 

### **3.2 Syllable shape inventories**

Chart notation: 
* Violation mark = *
- Filtered out losing candidate = !
> The exclamation points in this tableau are a standard way of highlighting why each suboptimal candidate lost out to the optimal one – that is they show which constraint filtered out that row’s losing candidate, in favour of the winning optimal one. Notice that the ordering of the rows in a tableau is arbitrary: each one simply lists a potential candidate and its violations. [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=11&selection=53,0,59,1|Tessier2015_Chapter3-1, page 11]]


*Designing the optimal phonological grammar*

Children’s syllables lack r, s, w, final consonants (l, t pronounced but not at end of word) across all languages studied (Eu Portuguese, Qu French, Am English)
- Consonant-Vowel syllable shape 
Some languages are CV/CVV only; Cayuvava, Hawaiian, Hua: but the inverse, VC, is much less common, and no languages are exclusively VC. 
	→ indicates that "optimal grammar" 

Child grammar is not exclusively CV, can also be CV(C): “somewhat optimal” example table 5, compare to Yakuts (6) which is also CV(C)
-> Grammar must “make reference to all the pieces of an optimal syllable” (56)

OT constraints: descriptions of output properties, enforced to varying degrees 
- NoComplexOnset: no onset contains more than one segment 
- NoCoda: no syllable contains a coda 
- NoComplexCoda: no coda contains more than one segment 
- Onset: no syllable lacks an onset
→ CV the only syllable structure that satisfies all of these

Spanish, Canto both follow NoComplexCoda

Depending on language, children will acquire more complex syllable structures (CCVC, CCV, VCC, etc.) in different orders

>  Syllable structure typology is fairly well understood across the world’s languages, so the comparisons between child and adult patterns are plausibly accurate. Thus, children’s stages of syllable structure provide an excellent empirical area in which to build our theory of developing phonological grammars [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=10&selection=4,0,7,65|p.10]]

### **3.3 Optimizing syllable shapes**
*Deletion*
How to follow NoCoda? Delete coda

Following all 4 constraints, how will we have enough forms to make a whole language? 
> So a constraint-based phonological grammar is built to do two things: first to filter out disprefered output structures, but second to **maintain the material that’s stored in underlying representations**. This is accomplished via a second set of constraints, which each require that properties of the input be faithfully reproduced in the output [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=12&selection=131,0,135,34|p.12]]

“Faithfulness constraints”
- Max (aka Don‘tDelete): input should be maximally preserved 

*How are constraints ranked?*

***How do we conform to constraints?***
- Deletion
- *Epenthesis*: Inserting new segments
	- New faithfulness constraint: 
	- Dep (Don’t epenthesize)

Ranking constraints: Dep must be lowest because we can conform to both other constraints as long as Dep is violated [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=17&selection=128,1,128,3|p17]]

### **3.4 More Choice in Optimization**

*New constraint:*?
- SonorantOnset: Sonorant segment in onset = violation

Depends on *context:* (relative sonority)
GlideOnset >> LiquidOnset >> NasalOnset >> FricOnset

Hebrew children example
- obstruent-obstruent clusters permitted
- Position in cluster: *closest to vowel survives*, not just sonority ranking
	- Contiguity (faithfulness constraint) 

> The additional tool that we will use to capture this ordering fact is a **faithfulness constraint**, proposed in the OT literature to explain other target language patterns, which prefers output strings to be contiguous in the input. This constraint (simply called CONTIGUITY) always prefers $/C_1C_2V/ \rightarrow [C_2V]$ in every case, simply because the alternative $[C_1V]$ involves two segments which are contiguous in the output but not the input. [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=29&selection=119,0,143,53|page 29]]

*If onset is already low sonority, contiguity matters more*

### **3.5 Consequences and alternatives**

Individual variability
>One kind of between-child variation suggests that the earliest stages of phonological production may not coincide with the initial state of phonological learning.

>What if children misperceive more complicated syllable structures as simpler ones?

**Issues w OT**

> At the beginning of the chapter, we assumed that inputs come unsyllabified to the learner’s grammar: inputs look like /CVCVC/ and outputs look like [CV.CVC]. It is instructive to note that this is also the usual assumption about adult grammars, but for different reasons. The already-mentioned reason for leaving syllable structure out of adult inputs is that syllabification is never contrastive: once you know the language-specific grammar, syllabification should always be predictable, and therefore needn’t be stored in the lexicon.

> If we think that children’s inputs are taken from the target forms, heard as adult outputs, this puts them in sharp contrast with the usual notion of underlying representations attributed in a phonology textbook to an adult native speaker – in the latter case, we usually posit the input as some abstract mental representation, not a fully-formed output.

Optimality Theory has some problems; for one, between-child variability demonstrates that phonological production and phonological learning are not always in the same order. There is also an assumption about UR vs SR, since adult inputs are “abstract mental representations” whereas childrens’ inputs are taken directly from adult outputs. There are also a variety of points about input syllable structure/lack thereof which are not explored in depth.

#### *3.5.3 Comparing Frameworks: Constraints vs. Rules Part 1*

Rules are applied *serially*
Constraints are applied in *parallel*

Constraints take into account (predict) *variability of resolutions* that are applied across languages and children
Rules focus on process of different resolutions 
- Misses the point bc/ not looking at end goal 
- More importantly: *attestation* ** what ? [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=37&selection=79,29,79,74|page 37]]


### **3.6 Methodology: Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Studies**
Longitudinal: 
- ie. (at least) once a month, an hour of data collection of child's *spontaneous* speech (playing w/ toys, storybooks)
	- OR once every 6 months, larger group OR family member collecting daily ('diary study') across range of contexts
- **Goal**: accumulate enough data to evaluate overall phonological development w/in small population

Data typically is collected audio

Cross-sectional:
- Focus on a particular structure or process
- Single session, large group
- Semi-structured tasks/games, asking children to name objects, describe pictures
- **Goal**: establish normative, age-related milestones & infer relative order of acquisition 

Both important <3

"One of the tricky balancing acts for the linguist studying phonological acquisition is to use these two data sources in tandem. How much stock should we put in any one child’s data? And then again, how should data aver- aged across multiple children be interpreted? These questions will become more crucial as we proceed, and as you consider your own interests in studying phonological development." (p.90)



## Guest Lecture - Tessier

What do you know when you know a language? 
- Do you memorize all components (syllables, sounds, words)
	- No: bc we can generate
- Something else/more/entirely different

- What do you know about the structure of the sounds, syllables, speech units of your language?

- What do you know when you know a language? 
- What do you know abt structure of sounds/syll/speech units ?
- why are unrelated lang similar?

→ Maybe human languages similar bc of human minds

### Pt 1 Syllable shapes (what we know)
**BL4 Spanish** 
- What are the sounds that are systematically missing? 
	- Second consonant in CCV -- (l, r)
	- l, r survive in other clusters: if consonant is in diff syllable, 2 can be in a row

**Japanese loan words**
- Vowel insertion between consonant sounds & vowels added to end of words ending in consonants
	- Strike → sitoraiku
	- tch & dj sounds are translated into similar sound
	- (How do you choose which vowel is inserted? question to be answered another time- but there is an anwer)
	- One consonant cluster preserved: n- or other nasal consonant, followed by d/k/plosive 
	- 
- Diff Japanese speakers do this diff, in part relating to knowledge of english 1

**Tibetan numerals**
- (in drawing bc/ too much IPA)
- Silent consonants part of UR and appear in some SR given correct contexts

/insert

#### Optimality theory: 
**Do not start syllables with two consonants**
- Languages have different levels of "comfort" with violating this: Japanese doesn't, english does

Nothing is perfect; we can only be *optimal*

| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| {bla}   | *!                         |              |           |
