### Optimality Theory 
**3.2 Syllable shape inventories**
*Designing the optimal phonological grammar*

Children’s syllables lack r, s, w, final consonants (l, t pronounced but not at end of word) across all languages studied (Eu Portuguese, Qu French, Am English)
- CV syllable shape 
Some languages are CV/CVV only; Cayuvava, Hawaiian, Hua: but the inverse, VC, is much less common, and no languages are exclusively VC. 

Child grammar is not exclusively CV, can also be CV(C): “somewhat optimal” example table 5, compare to Yakuts (6) which is also CV(C)
-> Grammar must “make reference to all the pieces of an optimal syllable” (56)

OT constraints: descriptions of output properties, enforced to varying degrees 
- NoComplexOnset: no onset contains more than one segment 
- NoCoda: no syllable contains a coda 
- NoComplexCoda: no coda contains more than one segment 
- Onset: no syllable lacks an onset
→ CV the only syllable structure that satisfies all of these

Spanish, Canto both follow NoComplexCoda

Depending on language, children will acquire more complex syllable structures (CCVC, CCV, VCC, etc.) in different orders

>  Syllable structure typology is fairly well understood across the world’s languages, so the comparisons between child and adult patterns are plausibly accurate. Thus, children’s stages of syllable structure provide an excellent empirical area in which to build our theory of developing phonological grammars [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=10&selection=4,0,7,65|p.10]]

**3.3 Optimizing syllable shapes**
*Deletion*
How to follow NoCoda? Delete coda

Following all 4 constraints, how will we have enough forms to make a whole language? 
> So a constraint-based phonological grammar is built to do two things: first to filter out disprefered output structures, but second to **maintain the material that’s stored in underlying representations**. This is accomplished via a second set of constraints, which each require that properties of the input be faithfully reproduced in the output [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=12&selection=131,0,135,34|p.12]]

“Faithfulness constraints”
- Max (aka Don‘tDelete): input should be maximally preserved 

*How are constraints ranked?*

***How do we conform to constraints?***
- Deletion
- *Epenthesis*: Inserting new segments
	- New faithfulness constraint: 
	- Dep (Don’t epenthesize)

Ranking constraints: Dep must be lowest because we can conform to both other constraints as long as Dep is violated [[Tessier2015_Chapter3.pdf#page=17&selection=128,1,128,3|p17]]

**3.4 More Choice in Optimization**
Stops/fricatives followed by liquids/glides, aka obstruants followed by sonorants. Sonorants = deleted

*New constraint:*?
- SonorantOnset: Sonorant segment in onset = violation

Depends on *context:*
GlideOnset >> LiquidOnset >> NasalOnset >> FricOnset

Hebrew children example
- obstruent-obstruent clusters permitted
- Position in cluster: closest to vowel survives

*Word-mediality* (3.4.4)
SyllableContact 

Medial codas cannot be saved while final codas are banned
