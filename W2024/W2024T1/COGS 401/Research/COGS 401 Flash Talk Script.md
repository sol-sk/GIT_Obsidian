Hi, I'm Sol, and I'm a COGS-Psych major and Visual arts minor. 
##### Cybernetics introduction
- How many of you have heard of cybernetics? How many of you could describe what it is? To be honest, I didn't really know what it was until an art history professor explained it to me. 
- Cybernetics refers to the study of feedback systems, where a systems' output is taken back in again as an input. While it began as a multidisciplinary field, it eventually split apart: into neuroscience and psychology, philosophy, theories of language, and the study of artificial neural networks, aka, computer science. Sounds familiar! 
- Cybernetics was pretty much the OG-COGS. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who co-chaired the first cybernetics conferences in the '40s, laid the foundation for artificial neural networks: their 1943 paper directly inspired Rosenblatt's Perceptron
- But then, if it's so foundational to COGS, why was my art history professor the one who taught me about it? Cybernetics, as I mentioned, split apart in the 70s, and is now a pretty vintage term. However, it lives on in a different one of its' sub-disciplines: art.
- Conceptual artists–artists interested first and foremosts in ideas and information–were a part of cybernetics from the 60s onward. 
- Many artists started exploring newly available digital media, creating art through software, digitization, and the internet. 
- Media art (aka digital art) has evolved alongside advancements in technology and some artists have begun using ANNs 
- My interest is on how we can learn more about perception and the mind through art, particularly art made using ANNs and other forms of artificial intelligence.

##### Methodology
- The basis for my research will be review of psychology articles, papers on cybernetic theory, and analysis of artworks. 
- Within psychology, I have two goals: understanding the visual cues which make something appear as having agency (cognitive capacity, "mindfulness"), and understanding the relationship of visual information to the development of our self-perception.
- With cybernetics, I'm going to bring in different theories of the structure of visual systems and the development of the mind. 
- Art provides a way of understanding perception and agency through direct visual experience; it can also be more exploratory and provocative. 
##### Why art?
- Our self-knowledge is shaped by our visual experience, as is our knowledge of others
- Perception–not just in theory, but in practice–is foundational to our understanding of the mind
- Artists now can use machine learning algorithms to demonstrate artificial visual processing: showing how it aggregates and interprets visual information, and highlighting recurring visuals from the data set: we learn about them, we can see them learn about us
- All of this is helpful in shaping our interactions with ANNs and our understanding of perceptual processes
##### Who cares?
- The feedback loop-to return to cybernetics-which is created when we see something and feel that we are being seen in return has a number of consequences. 
- If we perceive something as having a mind; being a cognitive agent; it takes on a moral character and becomes deserving of rights and protections. 
- Conversely, agents that we perceive as harmful and immoral are denied agency and dehumanized. 
- Psychology can provide a foundation for how these cognitive processes work
- Art can poke at these processes and visualize aspects of them 
- By functioning as a visual metaphor, art can make complex concepts in cognitive and perceptual science more accessible and intuitive. This, along with the sensory and emotive experience that art can provoke, helps us develop new theories and further the study of cognitive and perceptual sciences.
