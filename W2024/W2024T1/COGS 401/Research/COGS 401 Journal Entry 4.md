Denial of personhood and mind perception: 
The recognition as a person/as a "mind" within political context, dehumanization of subjugated groups. Example: Standing Bear, who in 1879 "sued the U.S. Government to be recognized as a person." (383)

This paper is an overview of research on 'mind perception', defining 'mind,' how we perceive others' minds, and why this matters in daily life. 

**Three basic research questions:** 
- "Do people think that a particular entity has a mind?"
- "What state is the other mind in?" 
- "What are the behavioural consequences of perceiving a mind in another entity?"

**Identifying the categories of mind perception**
- Two dimensions by which we understand other minds: 
- "Experience (the capacity to sense and feel)"
- "Agency (the capacity to plan and act)"
- Other division of representation: 
- "Human nature (the capacity for emotional responsiveness)"
- "Human uniqueness (the capacity for civility, rationality, and morality)"
- Dimensions of social evaluation:
- "Warmth (corresponding to experience)"
- "Competence (corresponding to agency)"

**Causes of mind perception in the perceiver**
Causal uncertainty: "mind of its own" 
- Perfectly predictable behavior "mindless"
- Mental states explain (most easily) behavior
- Teleological
- Lacking control: attributing power to other agent (ie God)
	- Confronting existential dread we seek God
- "In less existentially significant examples, simply being denied control over a set of animate marbles increases attributions of intentionality to those marbles, whereas being dispositionally inclined toward control in daily life increases the attribution of complex mental capacities to dogs" (384)

- Those who feel greater need to belong are more attentive to and accurate at identifying facial expressions in others

**Causes of mind perception in the perceived**
- Entities which produce negative outcomes are perceived as more agentic/intentional than positive
	- "express greater belief in an agentic God when attempting to understand suffering rather than salvation" 
- Seek explanation more for negatives than positives
- Humanlike appearance/move at humanlike speed
- Difference from self: less agentic (dehumanize disliked others, see earlier re: politics)
- Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC): associated with other mind perception 
	- Less activation for "out-group" members

**Consequences of mind perception in the perceiver**
- "Intensifies perceiver's psychological experience of events" (385)
	- Random events are less memorable than intentional bc of implications of recurrance, + relation between perceiver's actions and outcome?
- Causes self-consciousness: other minds will in turn perceive you 
- "Perceivers want to be evaluated positively by others, and the presence of another surveilling mind can therefore increase socially desirable behavior" - panopticon, God
- A poster with eyes decreases cheating bc reminds of surveillance
- "Researchers have suggested that belief in such surveilling minds is adaptive because it increases prosocial behaviors ... Exaggerating the presence of surveilling minds can have negative implications for the perceiver, as in the case of paranoid schizophrenics"

- Perceiving a situation with moral implications/components: if only one mind is present, another will be sought out/created
	- If someone is wronged, a perpetrator will be created and vice versa
- Moral events "template" has "moral agent" and "moral patient" (perpetrator and recipient)

- Moral typecasting (see Journal entry 2!)
- "That mind perception is tied so tightly to morality is no coincidence because moral events –consisting of punishment, condemnation,praise, and reward –are fundamentally social events"(386)

**Consequences of mind perception in the perceived**
- "Entities capable of experience (moral patients) areafforded moral rights, whereas entities capable of agency(moral agents) are afforded moral responsibility"

- Anthropomorphization and attribution of moral responsibility to computers

- Seeing real people as having less mind is much greater issue than over-attributing mind to non-minds

- People do not use their ability to, with some accuracy, reason about the minds of others as much as they should 

- Study of mind perception helps us understand the relation between perceived intentionality and meaning, surveillance and cooperation.
