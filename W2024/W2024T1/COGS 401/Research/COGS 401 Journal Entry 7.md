*How We Became Posthuman* N. Katherine Hayles

Hayles' book includes a chapter on the Macy Conferences, a cornerstone in the development of ANNs and cognitive science as a whole. Hayles point of interest in this book is the embodiment, or lack thereof, of information and cognitive systems–in this chapter, she provides an overview of the arguments that led to the triumph of information over materiality in research. The three arguments, she states, were regarding "the construction of information as a theoretical entity; the second, with the construction of (human) neural structures so that they were seen as flows of information; the third, with the construction of artifacts that translated information flows into observable operations, thereby making the flows 'real.'" (p. 50)

One crucial component of this chapter is Hayles' description of how information was shared between researchers at the conference: "Researchers might not have been able to identify in their own work the mechanism discussed by a fellow participant, but they could understand it metaphorically and then associate the metaphor with something applicable to their own field." (p. 51) These metaphors are not only helpful for understanding complex core concepts that were developed at the conference, but their use demonstrates the value of abstraction and to an extent poetics and artistry in scientific communication. 

Particularly in the context of performance, the description of MacKay's ultimately-beaten quantification of information as a representational action jumped out at me. 

There is much value in understanding the abstractions necessary to conceptualize and realize ANNs, as we consider abstracting them further to create productive, generative experiences 


> Although the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics were not the only forum grappling with these questions, they were particularly important because they acted as a crossroads for the traffic in cybernetic models and artifacts. This chapter charts the arguments that made information seem more important than materiality within this research community. Broadly speaking, the arguments were deployed along three fronts. The first was concerned with the construction of information as a theoretical entity; the second, with the construction of (human) neural structures so that they were seen as flows of information; the third, with the construction of artifacts that translated information flows into observable operations, thereby making the flows "real."

> Arguing for a strong correlation between the nature of a representation and its effect, MacKay's model recognized the mutual constitution of form and content, message and receiver. His model was fundamentally different from the Shannon-Wiener theory because it triangulated between reflexivity, information, and meaning. In the context of the Macy Conferences, his conclusion qualified as radical: subjectivity, far from being a morass to be avoided, is precisely what enables information and meaning to be connected.

> When information is made representational, as in MacKay's model, it is conceptualized as an action rather than a thing. Verblike, it becomes a process that someone enacts, and thus it necessarily implies con- text and embodiment. The price it pays for embodiment is difficulty of quantification and loss of universality

> Making information a thing allies it with homeostasis, for so defined, it can be transported into any medium and maintain a stable quantitative value, reinforcing the stability that homeostasis implies. **Making information an action links it with reflexivity, for then its effect on the receiver must be taken into account, and measuring this effect sets up the potential for a reflexive spiral through an infinite regress of observers**.

> Homeostasis won in the first wave largely because it was more manageable quantitatively. Reflexivity lost because specifying and delimiting context quickly ballooned into an unmanageable project.

> The tension between reified models and embodied complexities figures importantly in the next episode of our story. If humans are information-processing machines, then they must have biological equipment enabling them to process binary code. The model constructing the human in these terms was the McCulloch-Pitts neuron. The McCulloch-Pitts neuron was the primary model through which cybernetics was seen as having "a setting in the flesh," as Warren McCulloch put it. **The problem was how to move from this stripped-down neural model to such complex issues as universals in thought, gestalts in perception, and representations of what a system cannot represent.** Here the slippage between mechanism and model becomes important, for even among researchers dedicated to a hard-science approach, such as McCulloch, the tendency was to use the model **metaphorically to forge connections between relatively simple neural circuits and the complexities of embodied experience**. In the process, the disembodied logical form of the circuit was rhetorically transformed from being an effect of the model to a cause of the model's efficacy. This move, familiar to us as the Platonic backhand, made embodied reality into a blurred and messy instantiation of the clean abstractions of logical forms. Unlike others who make this move, however, McCulloch never relinquished his commitment to embodiment. **The tension between logical form and embodiment in his work displays how the construction of a weightless information was complicated when cybernetics moved into the intimate context of the body's own neural functioning.**
