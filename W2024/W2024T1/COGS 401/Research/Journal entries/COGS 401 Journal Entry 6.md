To hopefully help narrow down my research question, I will be focusing on the perception of other minds specifically, rather than perception of the self. My methodology is going to be outside of the typical research framework, as I have decided that my research is going to culminate in an artwork installation. Chris Mole has said that two students have done artworks for their 402 projects, and he encouraged me to be expansive with my concept for my 402 project, as long as it can incorporate the things that I’ve learned in the COGS program. 

**Background - Artists**

Prior to the design of the installation, I am continuing to research artists who have worked with generative programs, particularly from the past 10 years. My intention is to have a reasonably solid foundation of existing work that has been done in order to understand the breadth of possibility as well as identify “gaps,” similar to gaps in literature, fields/aspects of machine learning or generative AI which have not been explored in artwork. 

**Background - Cybernetics**

By also bringing in the background on cybernetics, I can understand the larger historical patterns in how we use, design, and identify with AI, as well as helping me link more abstract concepts as they were initially identified. 

**Implementing ML**


For the machine learning component of the artwork I am going to use the program TDNeuron. This is an add-on to the program I am currently using to make interactive artwork which allows me to add deep learning to my network. Specifically, I will be using the convolutional and pooling deep learning nodes for my installation to assign meanings to its visual inputs. 

The practical aspect of my methodology–the implementation of AI programs into an artwork–is going to (hopefully) be done in collaboration with Amber Frid-Jimenez, who has done work with homemade AI that I find interesting, and who also works with T’ai Smith.

**Why art?**

The purpose of doing an artwork rather than a research paper is because I feel that the connection between arts and sciences is productive and meaningful. Creating artwork can be just as much an investigation into a field as a traditional research experiment, and provides an opportunity to include a larger audience and with a looser structure. 

**Format & "beta-testing"**

The format of artwork that I’m interested in is a moderately large scale (as in, at least 7’ diagonal) projection, as from my preliminary artworks this semester, people have been most receptive to this design and are engaged. Being in a studio class has helped me really get a better sense of what sorts of qualities people are more interested in and how they impact the viewer, from a group of people who are paying attention to visual and spatial qualities of a work and who are able to give feedback on how it makes them feel, what it makes them think, and what specific aspects of it are relevant to the things I’m aiming to achieve. For example, the size: my first installation was in a smaller room as it was what I was able to book, so the projection was relatively small. However, a number of people said they wanted to see it larger, so I moved the projector and people instantly reacted positively. I was also able to see how people interact, and knew that I needed to have a different space that allowed for more movement as well as a better positioning of my camera to have the visual field be more akin to how an agent or other person would look directly at a person or multiple people.
