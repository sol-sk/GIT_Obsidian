Second-wave cy- bernetic discourse stressed that language is structurally coupled as a social system founded on a 'reciprocal consensus' and therefore not representative of an external reality but rather of 'consensual objects'\"\n\n\"Artist Scott Blake has attempted to emulate Close's pixel-aesthetics by creat- ing a software program, The Chuck Close Filter, that emulates and utilizes elements of Close's technique in order to create his very own Chuck-Close-like artworks. Scott Blake's Self Portrait Made with Chuck Close Filter (Fig. 3) demonstrates the po- tential of appropriating Close's aesthetics into a purely digital form and resonates strikingly with Close's work\"\n\n\"The key relation between third-wave cy- bernetics and digital art is exemplified in the conceptualization and practice of emergence, which has opened new hori- zons and modes of art production. Howard Rheingold correlates the emergence of an on-line 'collective intelligence' as analogous to the behavior of swarm sys- tems where agents residing on one scale produce higher-level behavior and patterns. Emergence may also occur when a recursive feedback loop evolves within a system in such as a way as to lead to previously unforeseeable phenomena\"\n\n\"Similarly, Lev Manovich perceptively points out that new-media objects are readymades by default and are in line with Barthes's criticism of the author as a sole-inventor, such that the text becomes a 'tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture'\"\n\n\"Similarly, Eduardo Kac utilizes emergence in his transgenic bioart. In Genesis (1999), Kac translated a quote from the Bible (Genesis 1:26) into Morse code and then converted it into a DNA sequence - ordered from a genetics lab - and infused it into a Pe- tri dish with fluorescent E. coli bacteria (Fig. 6). Finally, the bacteria's light source was connected to the Internet such that web users could turn it off and on, influencing the E. coli s unpredictable mutation.\"\n\n\"The question remains as to why there has been at minimum a 15-year lag be- tween the ideas proposed in cybernetics and their artistic counterparts. What caused this delay? While it takes time for ideas to seep into the social conscious- ness, artists are often capable of rapidly integrating ideas and conceptualizing new ones. Perhaps these ideas first had to be incorporated into the technologies these artists used...technological history is often the outcome of social struggles between pow- erful interest groups. Perhaps the correlation between cybernetics and art is itself a form of emergence?\"",

By recognizing that the **abstractions here are multilayered.** When McCulloch goes down a level, away from what information is toward what it does, he still ends up several layers away from embodied complexity.

It depends on how the perspective is constructed. **Controlling the context, particularly the movement from instantiated specificity to abstraction, was crucial** to constructing the pathways through which the McCulloch-Pitts neuron was made to stand simultaneously for a computer code and for human thought. **Transforming the body into a flow of binary code pulsing through neurons was an essential step in seeing human being as an informational pattern.

It signals, somewhat ironically, the ambivalence of the current paradigm of AI – deep learning – which emerged not from theories of cognition, as some may believe, but from contested experiments to automate the labour of perception, or pattern recognition.39 Deep learning has evolved from the extension of 1950s techniques of visual pattern recognition to non-visual data, which now include text, audio, video, and behavioural data of the most diverse origins. The rise of deep learning dates to 2012, when the convolutional neural network AlexNet won the ImageNet computer vision competition. Since then, the term ‘AI’ has come to define by convention the paradigm of artificial neural networks which, in the 1950s, it must be noted, was actually its rival (an example of the controversies that characterise the ‘rationality’ of AI).40 Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus illuminated this schism in their 1988 essay ‘Making a Mind versus Modeling the Brain’, in which they outlined the two lineages of AI – symbolic and connectionist – that, based on different logical postulates, have also followed different destinies.41 Symbolic AI is the lineage that is associated with the 1956 Dartmouth workshop for which John McCarthy coined the questionable term ‘artificial intelligence’.42 Its key applications have been the Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver – and the array of expert systems and inference engines in general – which were proven trivial and prone to combinatorial explosion. Connectionism, on the other hand, is the lineage of artificial neural networks pioneered by Frank Rosenblatt’s invention of the ‘perceptron’ in 1957, which unfolded into convolutional neural networks in the late 1980s and, eventually, launched the deep learning architecture that has prevailed since the 2010s\n\n[[The Eye of the Master A Social History of Artificial Intelligence (Matteo Pasquinelli).pdf#page=21&selection=25,0,104,29|The Eye of the Master A Social History of Artificial Intelligence (Matteo Pasquinelli), page 21]]",

They see abstractionism situated firmly within the modernist tradition and challenge its asser- tion of the possibility of identifying of grand, unifying “truths.” They question the possibilities of such universal themes and instead assert postmodern perspectives of relativity and diversity. To some of these critics, the work of artists dis- cussed in this section seems somewhat an anachronism—even though it uses the latest theories and tools. They would claim that the search for shapes and forms to express the underlying unity of the universe seems part of an abandoned discourse and not germane to the pressing issues confronting today’s world and art. The debate promises to continue into the future as art struggles to reconcile these different approaches.\n\n[[Information Arts Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology_Wilson.pdf#page=363&selection=0,11,10,85|Information Arts Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology_Wilson, page 363]]",

The equipment-free aspect of reality here has become the height of artifice; the sight of immediate reality has become an orchid in the land of technology.\n\n[[mechanical-reproduction_benjamin.pdf#page=13&selection=72,30,88,13|mechanical-reproduction_benjamin, page 13]]",

It is an age where dominant agencies of commu- nication produce the message systems that cultivate the dominant social patterns. They structure the public agenda of existence, priorities, values and relationships. It is these mutating consequences that become forces of acculturation, creating a new symbolic order.”27 To Brecht, technical in- novation, conventionally conceived, was in danger of primarily expanding the distribution of content and thus economic and ideological domina- tion under the guise of progress. He lambasted “the colossal triumph of technology at last to be able to make accessible to the entire world a Vien- nese waltz and a kitchen recipe.”28\n\n[[The-future-is-present_Glahn-Levine.pdf#page=23&selection=71,0,116,0|The-future-is-present_Glahn-Levine, page 23]]",

Artists are now searching for more com- plex forms of interactivity that call on deeper involvement by viewers. (For more discussion of the issue see chapter 7.1, which reviews theories of digital culture and art.) Some artists believe that artificial life and artificial intelligence offer an approach to explore a more interesting kind of interactivity. Artificial life is seen as promising because it allows the artwork itself to have a larger repertoire of behaviors that can generate novel behaviors through evolution, learning, and interactions with viewers.\n\n[[Information Arts Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology_Wilson.pdf#page=369&selection=15,0,23,84|Information Arts Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology_Wilson, page 369]]",
