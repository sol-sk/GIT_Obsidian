### Pre-meeting

- Focusing on paper concept over artwork
- more enjoyable for me to create art with more freedom/exploratory than cogs (as a program with constraints) lets me be/outside of rigid structure
	- Entirely possible and likely that I will make some art related to this research paper it just won't be for the project itself; 
	- If the SEA is interested in working together outside of this specific project (especially as I'm graduating) I'd love to explore that in the future


Paper concept, similar to presentation; **role of artist (broadly, abstraction) throughout development of cybernetics into modern ANNs/AI, conceptual influence** 
- → informing the kinds of approaches contemp artists can take or broadly the reciprocal influence of perception; 
	- metaphorical representations creating visual images creating conceptual understanding 
	- technological frameworks creating assumptions for kinds of uses/purpose
		- art which takes AI at face value and goes forward with it as a tool versus art which peels it apart 


Term: W2024T2

Project Title: Research Project on Visual Culture and Machine Learning 

*Briefly indicate the nature of the project. (Is it animal lab experiment, human subjects experiment, design/build project, philosophical essay, literature review, field work, artistic collaboration, etc.?)*

I will be working with T'ai Smith and Amber Frid-Jimenez on their research investigation “Reading Charisma: Art and Politics in the Age of AI,” which is funded by an SSHRC Insight Development Grant and by the Canada Research Development program. Frid-Jimenez is a Research Chair in Art and Design Technology. The result of this project will be a research paper on machine learning and art, including artworks from the mid-20th century to present. This paper will include analysis of Frid-Jimenez' current projects, in which she is training and using machine learning models to create artwork.
