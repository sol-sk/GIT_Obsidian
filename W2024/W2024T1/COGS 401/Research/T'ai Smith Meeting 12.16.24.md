### Pre-meeting

- Focusing on paper concept over artwork
- more enjoyable for me to create art with more freedom/exploratory than cogs (as a program with constraints) lets me be/outside of rigid structure
	- Entirely possible and likely that I will make some art related to this research paper it just won't be for the project itself; 
	- If the SEA is interested in working together outside of this specific project (especially as I'm graduating) I'd love to explore that in the future


Paper concept, similar to presentation; **role of artist (broadly, abstraction) throughout development of cybernetics into modern ANNs/AI, conceptual influence** 
- → informing the kinds of approaches contemp artists can take or broadly the reciprocal influence of perception; 
	- metaphorical representations creating visual images creating conceptual understanding 
	- technological frameworks creating assumptions for kinds of uses/purpose
		- art which takes AI at face value and goes forward with it as a tool versus art which peels it apart
