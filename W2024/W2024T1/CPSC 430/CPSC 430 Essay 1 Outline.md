> Write an outline summarizing your chosen article and state its thesis.

**Article:** "The AI we should fear is already here," Daron Acemoglu

**Thesis:** The current uses of AI are detrimental to society.


**Outline:**
- Introduction: 
	- Many people's (inc. big names) concerns about AI are about the theoretical future of potentially superhuman intelligence/AGI. 
	- Narrow AI is what we are currently dealing with and the threats it poses are more pressing
	- Paragraph summaries: reduces hiring, allows for increased surveillance, being used in bail and sentencing, and is interfering with democracy thru social media manipulation
- Worsening the labor-market
	- US economy already bad for workers; reduced earnings, offshore manufacturing
	- Counterargument: AI will increase productivity and thus human labor power
	- Rebuttal: AI is not going to increase productivity 
	- AI allows corporations to more closely monitor workers 
- Making biased decisions in government and criminal justice
	- Exacerbates inequity
- Surveilling and manipulating the voting populus. 
	- Monitoring user base & manipulating people's behavior
- We need to recognize the harms posed by current AI applications rather than the potential capabilities AI may have in the future

**Q1:**
> Pick a specific AI application described in one of the two articles and argue either that it will be beneficial or harmful overall

Application: AI allows for better monitoring of workers, such as in warehouses, delivery, and the restaurant and fast food industries.

- **Thesis:** AI-assisted employee surveillance techniques are detrimental to the job market. 
**Intro**
- Supervisory jobs have existed forever 
- This essay will assume that AI is even capable of being at least equivalent to, if not better than, human supervisors/managers. 
- AI cannot replace them

**P1**
- Data and privacy concerns 

**P2**
- Research - Schlund & Zitek 2024 shows productivity actually dereases w/ AI monitoring bc participants resist instruction more, & makes them feel loss of autonomy

**P3: Counterpoint**
- Study show negative effects disappear when AI is constructive rather than judgemental
- Study was in context of short, low stakes writing exercise. In warehouse, fast food, etc. settings where employees are already typically overworked and underpaid, this would still feel like shit
- Data concerns not addressed

**Conclusion**
- Negative affects of AI implementation on workers & loss of management positions → negative impacts on economy, workplace trust

**Draft**
Employee monitoring is far from new–supervisors, managers, foremen and other oversight positions play essential roles in the function of a workplace and productivity of workers. However, oversight positions cannot be swapped out for AI without significant consequences suffered by employees, and in turn, harming corporations and the economy as a whole. 

Data and privacy concerns. In order to learn and improve AI relies on flow of information. Large corporations are already collecting and selling massive amounts of personal data. Allowing more efficient and granular data collection introduces further loss of privacy and introduces security risk. Corporations do not need any more power over individuals than they already have. 

Cornell research showed that employees who were monitored by AI system which judged their customer service and workplace efficiency were more likely to resist and defy instructions, and felt a loss of autonomy (Schlund & Zitek, 2024). This not only worsens productivity, it negatively affects employee attitudes towards workplace goals. 

A potential response from AI proponents can be derived from the fourth part of the above study. When AI monitoring was framed as developmental rather than judgemental, participants did not report a perceived loss of autonomy nor did they resist the task or monitoring. Given this, couldn't we mitigate any negative impacts by having AI systems give helpful feedback to employees?
