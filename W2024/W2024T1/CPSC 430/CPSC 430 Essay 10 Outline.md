1. During an exceptionally busy week when all time slots at an invigilation facility are fully booked for course assignments, a software malfunction randomly cancels some students' reservations. A student who already has a reservation at a less convenient time notices that better time slots have become available due to these cancellations. Knowing that many of the affected students can only attend during the cancelled times, is it ethical for this student to change their reservation to one of these newly available slots?
2. If a company sends a consumer an incorrect bill, should the company be required to compensate the consumer for the time and effort the consumer takes to straighten out the mistake?
3. You are working on an open-source project in your free time, but your employer claims ownership of your code since it is related to the company’s area of work. Is it ethical for the company to demand this ownership?
4. At a job, you discover that one of the critical pieces of software you’re using is a bootlegged copy. You bring this up to your boss, who states that the software is too expensive and out of budget, and suggests getting a license in the distant future when the company has more money. How would you respond in this situation?
- Bootlegged software is not good, but it doesn't do anyone any direct harm–especially if the software is produced by a large company charging a significant recurring fee
