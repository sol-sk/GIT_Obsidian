Arguments in favor of ethical egoism are often based on the premise that it's most natural for people to act in their own self-interest. Explain why you agree or disagree with this premise.

Position: It is not most natural for people to act in their own self-interest

****Thesis: It is not most natural for people to act in their own self-interest; and if it were, this would not be an argument in favor of ethical egoism.*** 

**Arg 1: Humans have evolved as social creatures** 
- We are wired to require social connection 
- Maintaining social bonds requires acting outside of self-interest
- Collective development leads to more progress than individual development

**Counterargument: People do selfless things to reap the social/other rewards (so it can be natural to be self-interested while maintaining social connections)**
- Even if you can argue that short-term selflessness is long-term self-interest because it benefits people to have connections, this kind of roundabout argument is trying to co-opt selfless action towards a selfish argument, and it's impossible to know if all/most people are consciously, sub-consciously, or even at all thinking in this way (doing selfless acts out of self-interest)
	- Pessimistic view of humanity
- Even though it's impossible to know what other people are thinking, you can probably tell the difference between a person doing you a favor for selfless versus selfish reasons because their behavior will reveal their motives. I think most would prefer to be around people who behave genuinely selflessly than people who behave manipulatively selflessly. 

**Arg 2: Even accepting this premise, most natural â‰  most ethical**
- Premises should provide a logical basis for an argument
- Ethical egoists continue from this premise that because it is natural it is an appropriate moral philosophy to adopt
- Should morality be based on what is most natural? Many societal functions rely on managing "natural" urges to some degree (eg. holding in waste, having sex in appropriate locations/at appropriate times, not being violent towards others).
