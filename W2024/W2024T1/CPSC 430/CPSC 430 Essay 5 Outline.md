Prompts: 
1. In order to do business in China, Google agreed to limit the information it would make available to Chinese citizens. Did Google do the right thing?
2. Should a college or university have the right to suspend its students who brag about breaking its rules on social networks?

Social contract
-  Social contract theory states that we are bound by obligation to act with respect to the rights of others. Hobbes includes that part of this contract is the existence of a government to enforce these rules. 
- Some relevant rights (of students) in this case would be the right to privacy and the right to free expression.
- Social contract theory's stance is that illegal acts are only acceptable given a higher order moral obligation. If the illegal act is in violation with others' rights, it is immoral.
- Institutions enforcing their laws/rules is moral if the laws uphold "subjects" aka students' rights. 


Rule utilitarianism
- If universities can suspend students for breaking any rule and posting about it publically, this encompasses all infractions, no matter how harmful. 
- Universities can uphold their code of conduct: has general utility of maintaining order
- Negative: Takes away from education: suspension may often have more negative impact on student than their action had on university/student body
- Students lose trust in the institution to discipline fairly


Counterexample: 
- A student completes their thesis paper and is on track to graduate in a few months. However, they post on their public Twitter that their friend wrote the entire essay for them. A classmate sees and reports it to the dean, but neither the person nor their friend admit to it, and there's no way of proving which one of them actually wrote it. This person can not only get away with academic misconduct but advertises to other students that they can too. 
- This example should be used as evidence but not proof. If a student is so openly breaking a major rule, it's highly likely that there are other instances of plagiarism at some point in there degree which can be identified in other assignments they've submitted. If they've been a star student up until this point, it's worth considering if they were making a joke or why they felt the need to do this for their thesis, and see if speaking to them candidly about their situation can provide better insight into how to proceed. 
- This style may let students occassionally get away with malicious rule breaking, but it develops a much stronger and more trusting relationship between the student body and the administration, which benefits all parties in the social contract in the long run. 





According to rule utilitarianism and social contract theory, a university should not have the right to discipline students for their posts on social media. 

If universities begin to crack down on all instances of student rule-breaking by monitoring social media, it would create an environment of mistrust among the student body, and students would learn to exclusively use private methods of communication so as to avoid the administration. 

Counter: 
Universities have rules for a reason; if other students see blatant flouting with no consequence, it will lead to further rule-breaking and disrupt the order of the university. Part of the social contract of a university student is an agreement to abide by the rules set by the university. Further, if students are harmed by others breaking rules, they benefit from being able to use social media as evidence against students who have harmed them. 

Rebuttal: My argument is against suspension; evidence that a student has broken a rule that has been collected via social media by other students could be considered in a disciplinary procedure or added to a larger case with other forms of evidence. In this case, universities are still separate from students personal lives and students don't have to worry that they are being constantly surveilled, but students who have been wronged are still able to provide support for their case. 



Rule utilitarianism states that a rule is moral if everyone following it would result in the greatest overall happiness. 

It is beneficial to society–in this case, campus culture–if students follow university rules. 

"Obey the law unless (1) the law does not maximize utility, and (2) you have good reason to believe that the long-term net effects of breaking the law will be greater utility."


According to rule utilitarianism, universities do not have the right to suspend students for bragging about breaking rules. 

Would this rule, in all circumstances, result in the greatest happiness? If universities can enforce their rules, it benefits both the admin and the student body, as violations can be harmful to students and lack of governance would lead to bad actors having the freedom to harm others. However, we must consider the consequences of universalizing this rule. If suspension is a potential consequence for any online infraction, it will disrupt student culture by increasing paranoia and distrust in the administration. This interferes with their education and primes them for future distrust of authority. 

The positives of this rule are the maintenance of order and the expectation of students that their peers follow the same rules they do. Universities have the right to enforce their rules, since students know they are expected to follow them when they attend.
The negatives are the disruption of the student body, the restriction of freedom of expression and privacy in instances where those are expected, and the fueling of antagonism between students and the administration. 

Because generalizing this rule opens the possibility of widespread consequence for the student body and administration, both in a broad context and in violating individual students' rights, it does not offer the greatest utility nor uphold more rights.
