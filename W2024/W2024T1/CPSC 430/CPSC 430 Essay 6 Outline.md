1. Is intellectual property protection needed in order to promote innovation?
2. Is it immoral to copy music?

Intro: 
- It is immoral to copy music for personal gain, but not for creative/transformative use. 
- Virtue ethics

P1: When it is immoral
- Stealing is an innoble act
- Copying music in order to avoid paying the artist is immoral and not an action of a virtuous character. 
- Even worse is if music is copied to distribute or profit off of, taking more away from artist

P2: When it is moral
- Art is always referencing or building off of what has already been made. 
- A virtuous person can copy a soundbite and loop it to create a unique work of art without harming the artist whose work they sampled. 
- Virtuous person would understand when it is or is not disingenuous to use other people's work
- Getting permission & crediting artist = virtuous actions

P3: Counter
- Virtuous to make music accessible to those who cannot afford it; but this could be done virtuously
- Ie. Asking artist for permission to distribute, or buying song and playing it for people
