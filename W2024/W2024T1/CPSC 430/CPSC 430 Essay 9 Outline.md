##### Questions:

- 1. Q1: 
    
    Answer one of the following 2 essay questions using one of the workable ethical theories:
    
    1. If your neighbour’s wireless network extends into your home, is it ethically wrong for you to use the network to get free Internet access, provided you do not affect them directly (slow down their connection; download illegal files; exceed their data cap; etc)?
    2. Is it ethical for a country to interfere in another country's election either directly (e.g., by hacking voting machines) or indirectly (e.g., via a misinformation campaign) if doing so advances the first country's interests?
    
    I've attached some relevant news articles; these are by no means necessary to effectively answer the essay question, but may provide some helpful context for those who are unfamiliar. Feel free to do your own research as well!

Virtue ethics
Does the good thing: 
Good time: 
Right reason: 





Social contract theory; 

Like individuals, national governments are bound to each other by a social contract, holding countries to a certain standard to enforce the rights of the people. A component of this contract is the right to for a national government to rule only its own nation, and be held accountable to its own people. Interfering in another country's election violates the contract.

P1: Right to free and fair election; countries/people have negative right for democratic process to be uninterfered with
- Negates democratic right
- Installs government potentially harmful to the people

P2: The social contract, in addition to establishing the set of moral rules, also includes an implicit agreement to a government which enforces those. In this case,  it would be international governing bodies which forbid interference in foreign elections.
