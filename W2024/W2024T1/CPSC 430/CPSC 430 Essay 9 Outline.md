##### Questions:

- 1. Q1: 
    
    Answer one of the following 2 essay questions using one of the workable ethical theories:
    
    1. If your neighbour’s wireless network extends into your home, is it ethically wrong for you to use the network to get free Internet access, provided you do not affect them directly (slow down their connection; download illegal files; exceed their data cap; etc)?
    2. Is it ethical for a country to interfere in another country's election either directly (e.g., by hacking voting machines) or indirectly (e.g., via a misinformation campaign) if doing so advances the first country's interests?
    
    I've attached some relevant news articles; these are by no means necessary to effectively answer the essay question, but may provide some helpful context for those who are unfamiliar. Feel free to do your own research as well!
