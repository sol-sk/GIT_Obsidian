Not only are you being seen by a computer, which learns, changes, reacts and responds to your physical presence as it understands itâ€“it is how we as humans perceive and respond to it, and how we interact with each other. 

You are being observed by not only the computer, but everyone in the room. The computer's reaction is made into art and spectacle as a mechanism for understanding human-machine and human-human interaction. Computers are not borne of nothing; they are deliberately created and often modelled after the best understanding we have of our own cognitive processes. At the same time, we cannot fully access the mechanisms of deep learning (machine learning, by artificial neural networks), which is to some degree independent from its programming and design.
