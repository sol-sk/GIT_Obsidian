Adversaries = "friendly enemies"
- Have commonality
- Share symbolic space
Undo innocence of participation; "conflictual participation as a productive form of interventional practice"

Conflict vs "innocent" participtn:
- not "contrary provocation" but "micro-political"; participant = active agent, insisting on agency in field they enter; participation = critical engagement

"Multitude"; multiple differences carrying power of different positions
- Gramsci: appropriation of cultural institutions
- Role of culture in revolution: establishing counter-instituions as a slow transformation rather than military coup of economic base

Complexity can only be captured through conflict

Conflict creates new knowledge
- Outside vs inside; outsider has crucial power of dissonance; "allows for a forceful injection of external knowledge that is alien to the system one engages with"

Cooperation as anti-sharing knowledge, vs collaboration which implies heterogeny

"Collaboration presumes rhizomatic structures where knowledge grows exuberantly and proliferates in a rather unforeseeable fashion"; presents most revolutionary potential

- Density promotes healthy and productive antagonism
