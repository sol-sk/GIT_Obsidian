The equipment was fine; it was simply that by most parameters the water coming out of the fact my was as clean as-- or even cleaner than the water going in.

> Instead of assuming that all products are to be bought, owned, and disposed of by "consumers," products containing valuable technical nutrients-cars, televisions, carpeting, computers, and refrigerators, for example-would be re-conceived as services people want to enjoy. In this scenario, customers (a more apt term for the users of these products) would effectively purchase the service of such a product for a defined user period- say, ten thousand hours of television viewing, rather than the television itself.

> The advantages of this system, when fully implemented, would be threefold: it would produce no useless and potentially dangerous waste; it would save manufacturers billions of dollars in valuable materials over time; and, because nutrients for new products are constantly circulated, it would diminish the extraction of raw materials (such as petrochemicals) and the manufacture of potentially disruptive materials, such as PVC, and eventually phase them out, resulting in more savings to the manufacturer and enormous benefit to the environment.
