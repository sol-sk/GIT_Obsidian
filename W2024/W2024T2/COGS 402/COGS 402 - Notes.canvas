The so-called \"history of technology\" is also a process of microengineering which continually changes perception itself. And regardless of the rumors of disembodied lives, cryogenic havens, and bodiless zones which have accompanied these speeding machines, the digital revolution has spawned a vast swathe of debate about cyborgs, replicants, and other posthuman, inhuman, extrahuman entities which are complicating orthodox Western notions of what it is to be a human being. These are new ideas, and also more than this. Self-control, identity, freedom, and progress have long been argued out of court by postmodern theorists who have spents at least twenty years discussing the decline of all the great values and principles of the modern world. But nothing ever changes in theory. These debates are smoke rising from a very real arson attack on man's illusions of immunity and integrity. Intelligent life can no longer be monopolized. And far from vanishing into the immateriality of thin air, the body is complicating, replicating, escaping its formal organization, the organized organs which modernity has taken for normality. This new malleability is everywhere: in the switches of transsexualism, the perforations of tattoos and piercings, the indelible markings of brans and scars, the emergence of neural and viral networks, bacterial life, prostheses, neural jacks, vast numbers of wandering matrices. \n\n[[zeros-and-ones_plant.pdf#page=182&annotation=16090R|zeros-and-ones_plant, page 182]]",

Hatred, Ahmed stresses, organizes bodies. It is an emo- tional “investment” that makes certain bodies responsible for pain or injury. It organizes by bringing things and bodies together— by linking certain figures together so they become a common threat, an X to “our” O. Hate transforms the particular into the general: it transforms individuals into types so they become a common threat (I hate you because you are Y)\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=99&selection=29,23,51,30|Pattern-Discrimination, page 99]]",

Today you may want to obtain a degree in computer science . . . .” This is because network science, combined with “increasingly penetrating digital technol- ogies,” places us in “an immense research laboratory that, in size, complexity, and detail, surpasses everything that science has en- countered before.” This lab reveals “the rhythms of life as evidence of a deeper order in human behavior, one that can be explored, predicted, and no doubt exploited” (Barabási 2010, 11). Network science unravels a vast collective nonconscious, encased within the fishbowl of digital media.3 It is the bastard child of psychoanalysis: there are no accidents, no innocent slips of the tongue. Each action is part of a larger pattern/symptom. The goal: to answer that unan- swerable question, what do (wo)men want?\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=83&annotation=691R|Pattern-Discrimination, page 83]]",

Discom- fort is hence not about assimilation or resistance, but about inhabiting norms differently. The inhabitance is gen- erative or productive insofar as it does not end with the failure of norms to be secured, but with the possibilities of living that do not “follow” those norms through.

Because of this, they were profoundly disoriented, unable to con- nect their local experience (authenticity) to global systems (truth). **To resolve this situation, Jameson called for cognitive mapping, a yet imaginable form of political socialist art, which corresponded to “an imperative to grow new organs, to expand our sensorium and our body to some new, yet unimaginable, perhaps ultimately impossible, dimensions”** (39). Like the cognitive mapping Jameson envisioned, network science lifts the fog of postmodernism by re- vealing the links between the individual to the totality in which she lives.\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=83&selection=34,32,52,6|Pattern-Discrimination, page 83]]",
