The movement away from others, which grounds models of homophily, reveals the extent to which hatred precedes homophily. The hatred that networks foster, then, should surprise no one. Hatred, Ahmed stresses, organizes bodies. It is an emo- tional “investment” that makes certain bodies responsible for pain or injury. It organizes by bringing things and bodies together— by linking certain figures together so they become a common threat, an X to “our” O. Hate transforms the particular into the general: it transforms individuals into types so they become a common threat (I hate you because you are Y)\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=99&selection=29,23,51,30|Pattern-Discrimination, page 99]]",

Because of this, they were profoundly disoriented, unable to con- nect their local experience (authenticity) to global systems (truth). **To resolve this situation, Jameson called for cognitive mapping, a yet imaginable form of political socialist art, which corresponded to “an imperative to grow new organs, to expand our sensorium and our body to some new, yet unimaginable, perhaps ultimately impossible, dimensions”** (39). Like the cognitive mapping Jameson envisioned, network science lifts the fog of postmodernism by re- vealing the links between the individual to the totality in which she lives.\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=83&selection=34,32,52,6|Pattern-Discrimination, page 83]]",

Ideally, it is possible to elude the interpreters in another way, by making works of art whose surface is so unified and clean, whose momentum is so rapid, whose address is so direct that the work can be…just what it is.\n\n[[against-interpretation_sontag.pdf#page=4&selection=137,0,155,28|Sontag-Against+Interpretation, page 4]]",

      "text": "> According to the acclaimed network scientist and author Albert-László Barabási, network science obviates the need for human psychology: “In the past, if you wanted to understand what humans do and why they do it, you became a card-carrying psychologist. Today you may want to obtain a degree in computer science . . . .” This is because network science, combined with “increasingly penetrating digital technol- ogies,” places us in “an immense research laboratory that, in size, complexity, and detail, surpasses everything that science has en- countered before.” This lab reveals “the rhythms of life as evidence of a deeper order in human behavior, one that can be explored, predicted, and no doubt exploited” (Barabási 2010, 11). Network science unravels a vast collective nonconscious, encased within the fishbowl of digital media.3 It is the bastard child of psychoanalysis: there are no accidents, no innocent slips of the tongue. Each action is part of a larger pattern/symptom. The goal: to answer that unan- swerable question, what do (wo)men want?\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=83&annotation=691R|Pattern-Discrimination, page 83]]",

The interpreter, without actually erasing or rewriting the text, is altering it.

      "text": "> Crucially, these algorithms perpetuate the discrimination they “find.” They are not simply descriptive but also prescriptive and per- formative in all senses of that word. Capture systems, as Phil Agre theorized in 1994, reshape the activities they model or “discover.” Through a metaphor of human activity as language, they impose a normative “grammar of action” as they move from analyzing captured data to building an epistemological model of the captured activity (364)\n\n[[Pattern-Discrimination.pdf#page=80&selection=2,0,11,14|Pattern-Discrimination, page 80]]",
