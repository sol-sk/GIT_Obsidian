Turing test based on an "old parlor game" where a man had to "pass" in conversation as a woman

> It has always been said that “‘computing ma- chines can only carry out the purposes that they are instructed to do. This is certainly true,” writes Turing, “in the sense thatif they do something other than what they were instructed then they have just made some mistake.” But one man’s mistake might well be a most intelligent move for a machine. And how would their masters tell the difference between failures to carry out instructions and refusals to be bound by them? Perfection never guarantees success. On the contrary, **“the more it schizophrenizes, the better it works.” And for wayward systems like the rebel replicants, identity is easy to simulate and merely one of many programs to be run.**

Without meaning, without discursion (["You are not an angel", Moran](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14790726.2024.2334955))

"According to Aquinas, what really happens during such angelic visitations is that the angels simulate speech-sounds so that human beings can grasp something that is, taken in itself, pureless intelligible. Angels, then, engage in just the sort of *simulacrum* of discursive thinking that LLM output appears to exemplify."
