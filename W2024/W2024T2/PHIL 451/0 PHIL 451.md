#### Enlightenment
**Physicalism/Materialism**
- Proposition that both terrestrial and astronomical phenomena can be explained by the same laws (physics) → some (inc. Hobbes) conclude that all natural phenomena can be described by mathematical physics; *everything is physical*
	- Hobbes - first to articulate a computational theory of thought
**Dualism (& broadly, antiphysicalism)**
- Descartes
- Scientists/humans (*beings with minds*) 'systematically elude physical explanation'
- Bodies are governed by mechanical laws, minds are not

**Physicalist strategies**
- *Causation
- If our mental states affect the physical world (ie. a thought leads to an action), they must be physical

**Antiphysicalist strategies**
What can't we explain in physical/mechanistic terms?
- *Content*: aka intentionality, mental representation
	- How can a mental state represent things other than themselves? 
	- (What it is that you love, where it is that you go, etc. Some debate about if intentionality is a quality of all mental states or not)
- *Consciousness*: aka qualia - subjective quality, phenomenology
	- Something that we feel and can recognize but not easily verbalize - 'what it's like'
	- Many consider the most puzzling aspect

***What is physicalism?***
Completeness question: What does it mean to say that *everything* is physical? 
Condition question: What counts as physical? What are our criteria?

Physicalism: worldview of science

***What does it mean to say everything is physical?***
#### Physicalism: strict numerical identity, 'Identity Physicalism'
"**Entity**" - most generic word for a 'thing' to avoid categorizing 
All numerical entities are identical to physical entities 
- Metaphysical distinction between *particulars*: object, e.g. piece of chalk, which is individual, unrepeatable, and exists in a specific temporal and spatial period, and *properties*: the ways that it is, color
- Predication of subject = attribution of a property. *Property is repeatable*. *Particular/subject is not*
	- Tokens/types: "a a b" = How many letters? 3 tokens, and 2 types. 
Two kinds of Identity Physicalism
- **Token-Identity Physicalism**: Particulars
	- All actual particulars are physical objects
	- Too strong and too weak
		- Not every concept has to be a physical object
		- Anti-physicalists can still think all particulars are physical; all particulars are physical, and some have nonphysical properties (*Property dualist* view, of many contemporary dualists - in contrast with Descartes' dualism)
- **Type-Identity Physicalism** (also called **Reductive Physicalism**): Properties
	- Every property of an object is a physical property 
	- J.C.C. Smart, 'Sensations and Brain Properties'; the mental property of feeling something, thinking something, is the same as certain physical properties of the brain
		- e.g. C fiber activation = being in pain, 'neural correlate of pain'
		- Argument from parsimony/simplicity
	- *Reduces* a property to a physical property; a property is nothing but a physical property: metaphysically reduces the experience of pain to a brain state
	- (skipped slide about reductionism)
	- *Multiple realizability argument against reductive physicalism*
		- Example: we come in contact with an alien species, we get along swimmingly, politics, friendships, relationships, now intertwine; then, we do an autopsy and find they have no brain, no physical location for all the emotions they express: do you now discount all emotions they showed as not real? 
		- Octopi similar: far different brains, but show mentality (thought, emotional (?sort of?) reactions)
		- [[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 2.pdf#page=14&selection=0,43,2,21|PHIL451 002 - Lecture 2, page 14]]
		- Relationship between mental and physical is not 1:1, other materials/mental states can be associated with things like pain in other creatures
