#### Enlightenment
**Physicalism/Materialism**
- Proposition that both terrestrial and astronomical phenomena can be explained by the same laws (physics) â†’ some (inc. Hobbes) conclude that all natural phenomena can be described by mathematical physics; *everything is physical*
	- Hobbes - first to articulate a computational theory of thought
**Dualism (& broadly, antiphysicalism)**
- Descartes
- Scientists/humans (*beings with minds*) 'systematically elude physical explanation'
- Bodies are governed by mechanical laws, minds are not

**Physicalist strategies**
- *Causation
- If our mental states affect the physical world (ie. a thought leads to an action), they must be physical

**Antiphysicalist strategies**
- *Content*: Intentionality, mental representation
	- How can a mental state represent things other than themselves? 
	- (Wh)
- *Consciousness*:
