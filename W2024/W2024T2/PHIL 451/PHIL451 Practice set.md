### Section 1: Understanding physicalism 

1. *Explaining the thesis of physicalism requires an answer to both the ‘completeness question’ and the ‘condition question’. What are these two questions?* 
Completeness question: what does it mean to say *everything* is physical?
- 'Strict numerical identity'
	- Token/type- particulars vs properties 

Type = Reductive physicalism
- JCC Smart: CFF = pain
- Reduces prop to physical prop

Condition question: what does it mean to say everything is *physical*?
- Montero
- Hempel's dilemma 

2. *To which of these questions does ‘supervenience physicalism’ (a.k.a., ‘minimal physicalism’) offer a candidate answer?*
Supervenience offers an answer to the completeness quesiton

3. *Explain the thesis of supervenience/minimal physicalism.* 

"Global properties are nothing but patterns in the dots .. no two pictures could differ in their global properties without differing {in dots somewhere}"

Mental characteristics are dependent on physical characteristics 

"Physicalism is true at a possible world *w* iff any world that is a minimal physical duplicate is a complete duplicate (simpliciter)"

4. *“Physicalists claim that the mind is physical”. Does this provide an adequate formulation of physicalism? Why or not why?* 
No; property dualism. 

5. *What is the standard motivation for being a ‘non-reductive’ physicalist?* 

Embrace multiple realizability, affirm property nonidentity
Role functionalism
- "hardware/software"
- Mental states = second order functional role property ("higher order") -- having some property which plays a certain role
- "Pain is the property of having some property that realizes the pain role"

6. *Drawing on the notion of supervenience, explain how non-reductive physicalism and property dualism differ.* 

Prop dualism doesn't believe in supervenience; min phys duplicate ≠ simpliciter

7. *Describe one way that a non-reductive physicalist might develop the claim that mental properties metaphysically supervene on physical properties. (Note: we discussed some candidate proposals in the course of discussing Karen Bennett’s contribution to the mental causation debate).* 

We can order properties in terms of how abstract/**determinate** they are: scarlet vs red
- Scarlet is a determinate way of being red because red is instantiated in virtue of being scarlet

8. *What is the difference between a priori (‘type-A’) physicalism and a posteriori (‘type-B’) physicalism? (More specifically, what commitment does the former accept that the latter rejects?).* 

A: P is **epistemically transparent**


9. *What is Hempel’s dilemma for physicalism?* 

"Can we use an incomplete definition of physics, or can we use a hypothetically... "complete"? physics that is unproven ?

→ physicalism is either obviously false or trivially true"


9. *On the basis of Hempel’s dilemma and other challenges, Barbara Montero defends a specific way of understanding the debates that have historically taken place under the moniker of the ‘mind-body problem’. What is that understanding?* 

We can only debate mind-body problem if we know what exactly "body" is: Hempel's dilemma shows we don't
- No answer to condition question

Replace "physical" w/ "fundamental"
- Is mental fundamental? 

10. How would you intuitively explain the basic idea behind physicalism? 

### Section 2: Mental causation 

1. *David Papineau offers a ‘causal argument’ for physicalism and against dualism. Explain this argument. (Note: at least one of Papineau’s assumptions is unstated).* 
Causal argument: physics is causally complete so consciousness must either by physical or epiphen.

Efficacy
- Mental can sufficiently cause physical
Completeness
- Every phys event has a fullly sufficient physical cause
No systematic overdetermination (S(C)OD)
- Phys effects do not systemically have more than one fully sufficient cause

Bonus: Exclusion
- No effect has more than one sufficient cause unless it is causally overdetermined

2. *The argument you just summarized rests on numerous assumptions. Briefly indicate an intuitive motivation that one might provide for each of those premises.* 

- Deny efficacy: Reject 'Alexander's dictum': to be is to have causal powers. Intentional agency ceases to meaningfully exist
- Deny no systematic overdetermination: Treat all mental-physical causation as "death by firing squad"–It seems (to many) extremely implausible that mental→physical causation is systematically/pervasively overdetermined
- Deny exclusion: To deny that an event's having more than one sufficient cause is by itself sufficient for being causally overdetermined

2. *Explain why some philosophers (e.g., Jaegwon Kim) have held that an argument like Papineau’s is not an argument for just any form of physicalism but for a specific, controversial version of physicalism.* 

**Kim**: 
- If we reject distinctness, like Papineau aims to, we arrive at reductive
- Papineau is arguing for reductive physicalism (type-identity theory)

3. *According to Karen Bennett, Papineau was right all along to regard the causal argument (or the ‘causal exclusion problem’) as an argument for physicalism (rather than, as Kim suggests, a specific, controversial form of physicalism). According to Bennett, which assumption (left implicit in Papineau’s original presentation) is the physicalist in a position to reject but the dualist is not?* 

We can reject exclusion instead of distinctness. Dualist can't reject exclusion b/c they can't say O1/2 are false/vacuous: 

1: Dualism entails that m can happen without p definitionally 
2: Dualism entails that p can happen without m 

Dualist must say that m and p are both independently causally sufficient for e

4. *Bennett invokes counterfactual conditionals to make her point. Briefly describe the counterfactual conditional that, on Bennett’s view, is either false or vacuously true if physicalism is true.*

**(O1)** If m had happened without p, e would still have happened: (m & ¬p) □→ e. 
**(O2)** If p had happened without m, e would still have happened: (p & ¬m) □→ e.

O2: "causal sufficiency"
- If what is causally sufficient for e is p, strictly defined, *together with a whole host of complicated extrinsic factors regarding all the background conditions for p’s occurrence*, then O2 is vacuous. This is because, given supervenience physicalism, *p + background conditions* metaphysically necessitates m.
- If, on the other hand, what is causally sufficient for e is simply p, strictly defined, then O2 is false. This is bc p w/o background could be *petri dish* etc., which nobody thinks is sufficient

5. *Using the notion of a ‘zombie’ to illustrate why dualists adopt a different stance on the truth value of this counterfactual.* 

Physical being which lacks phenomenal consciousness

**Review what this means for Bennett**

6. *Which premise in Papineau’s causal argument does Sophie Gibb object to, and why?* 

Completeness relies on conservation of energy but this energy doesn't have to just be physical energy; accomodates dualism

**Gibb exclusion: no physical effect has a non-physical cause**

She proposes in order to make Papineau's premises follow to G.Excl, must add physical affectability, redistribution: but these are unfounded and raise further problems

7. *Gibb defends a non-standard version of interactionist dualism. What makes her version of interactionist dualism non-standard?* 

Double preventors 


### Section 3: Naturalizing intentionality/mental representation 

1. What do philosophers of mind mean when they speak of the ‘intentionality’ (a.k.a., the ‘intentional content’ or ‘representational content’) of a mental state? 

2. Considered as a type of relation (between the representing system and the represented object), intentionality can seem intuitively puzzling from a physicalist perspective. Give two examples to illustrate why this is so. 

3. One way that physicalists have hoped to remove the air of mystery around the representational content of mental states is by regarding it as somehow composed of natural relations like reliable indication. What is ‘reliable indication’, and what might lead one to believe that it could contribute to explaining how mental states represent what they do? 

4. There are two (closely related) objections to the claim we can explain the content of a mental representation solely in terms of what the representation reliably indicates (i.e., to the claim that X represents Y if and only if X reliably indicates Y). These are the ‘misrepresentation problem’ and the ‘disjunction problem’. Explain one of these problems, and the explanatory demand that it places on a successful theory of intentional/representational content. 

5. Some theorists (e.g., Dretske, Millikan, and Neander) argue that we can answer the misrepresentation problem and disjunction problem by appealing to a mental representation’s evolved ‘proper function’ (a.k.a., ‘teleofunction’). Describe one such proposal, and how it claims to overcome the problem you described above. 

6. Raise an objection to the view you just described. (Your answer should indicate whether the objection targets the specific teleosemantic proposal you described in your answer to the previous question, the whole teleosemantic approach of using proper functions to explain a mental representation’s intentional content, or to the broader physicalist project of attempting to explain intentionality in non-intentional terms). 

### Section 4: Phenomenal consciousness 

1. *Fill in the blanks of the following argument from Descartes (‘The Conceivability Argument’).* 
	1. P1. I can clearly and distinctly conceive of my `____` existing without my` ____ `existing. 
	2. P2. Whatever is clearly and distinctly conceivable is `____`. 
	3. C1. It is `_____` for my `_____` to exist without my `____` existing. 
	4. C2. My `_____` is not my` _____`. 

mind, body
possible
possible, mind, body
mind, body

3. *In Lecture 3 of Naming and Necessity, Kripke considers an influential objection to Descartes’ conceivability argument associated with the reductive physicalist, J.C.C. Smart. Describe that objection. (Clue: the objection draws parallels with famous examples in the history of science of theoretical identification such as ‘water is identical to H20’).* 

Smart: C2 doesn't follow from C1: only *contingently*
Pain is contingently = CFF 
- Diff modes of presentation

Kripke: If rigid designators are =, they are *necessarily* identical

Water = H2O is necessarily true, not contingently 

So: C1 → C2 *is valid* if P1 & P2 true

4. *Explain why, according to Kripke, the necessary a posteriori status of truths like ‘water is identical to H20’ poses a challenge to the popular physicalist objection to the conceivability argument.* 

C2 follows *necessarily* from C1

5. *At first glance, statements like “water is identical to H2O” appear contingent. How does Kripke propose to explain that appearance?* 

Heat = MMM same kind of statement as water = H2O 

Why does it appear contingent? 

It is falsely contingent, bc the world we imagine where heat ≠ MMM, we imagine something other than MMM causing properties of heat, which is scientifically impossible; conceivability arises at the level of our *sensation of heat*, which can plausibly be caused by other things (capcasin)

Condensed: apparently contingent relationship arises from confusing 
heat (physics) w/ heat (sensation)
heat (physics) necessarily MMM
heat (sensation) contingently MMM

6. *According to Kripke, can we explain the apparent contingency of statements like “pain is C-fibre activation” in the same way? Explain.* 

Pain *just is* the appearance of pain -- "appearance of contingency" can't be explained like heat

7. Explain Frank Jackson’s ‘knowledge argument’ against physicalism. 

8. What is the specific version of anti-physicalism that Jackson goes on to endorse on the basis of this argument? 

9. Could a physicalist appeal to the ‘Causal Completeness of the Physical’ (a.k.a., ‘Closure’) to object to the position you just described? Why or why not? 

10. Explain David Chalmers’ zombie argument against physicalism. 

11. The anti-physicalist arguments we’ve discussed depend on a particular understanding of physicalism. What is that understanding? 

12. Describe the two main options available to a physicalist in responding to these arguments. 

13. Between the two available options, which (in your view) seems the most promising for a physicalist? Give an example of how that option has been pursued in the literature. 

14. Having seen the arguments for and against physicalism, where do you find yourself landing? And what specific version of physicalism or anti-physicalism do you currently find most attractive? 

15. Is there a respect in which you think the metaphysical debates we’ve been learning about in this class might be improved?
