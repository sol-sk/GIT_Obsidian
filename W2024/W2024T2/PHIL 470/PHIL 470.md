~700 BCE, before Greeks
"first text of world philosophy"
### Brhadaranyaka 4.3-4.4 (pp.58-68)
**Yajnavalkya**
- Great teacher, sarcastic, irreverent 
- Poking fun at other priests who he interprets as not knowing the meaning of the text
- Defeats 8 brahmins in debate, including the woman Gargi, who is strongest–tells others not to bother once she's been defeated
	- Women in Upan.; patriarchal society, but there are components of it (Gargi, Maitreyi-1st wife of Yaj.), who are portrayed as interested in philosophy, intelligent
- Wives: Maitreyi, Katyayani 
- Eventually leaves society, ascetic way of life 
Tradnl ways of life being undermined, questioning of tradnl. rituals → asceticism, rigorous rituals of mind and body, to find liberation ("original hippies")→ Buddha arises from this 

"Sun rises and sets, the self is always there"
- From outwards to inwards
- The true self shines constant (Fire, light metaphors throughout) - luminosity of true consciousness
- Dreaming = traveling, change to mode of awareness 
	- In the dream state, the self is a creator; dream state is handling the materials of the mind, inc. materials from previous lives
		- *All experiences leave an impression* - this is why, in asceticism, it is crucial to pay attention to what your mind is drawn to and to cultivate good thoughts
	- Self ≠ mind
