# 01.07.25 Lecture 1

# 01.09.25 Lecture 2 
~700 BCE, before Greeks
"first text of world philosophy"
### Brhadaranyaka 4.3-4.4 (pp.58-68), partial recap of Lecture 1
##### Yajnavalkya (abbr. Yaj.)
- Great teacher, sarcastic, irreverent 
- Poking fun at other priests who he interprets as not knowing the meaning of the text
- Defeats 8 brahmins in debate, including the woman Gargi, who is strongest–tells others not to bother once she's been defeated
	- Women in Upan.; patriarchal society, but there are components of it (Gargi, Maitreyi-1st wife of Yaj.), who are portrayed as interested in philosophy, intelligent
- Wives: Maitreyi, Katyayani 
- Eventually leaves society, ascetic way of life 
Tradnl ways of life being undermined, questioning of tradnl. rituals → asceticism, rigorous rituals of mind and body, to find liberation ("original hippies")→ Buddha arises from this 

"Sun rises and sets, the self is always there"
- From outwards to inwards
- The true self shines constant (Fire, light metaphors throughout) - luminosity of true consciousness

**Dreams**
- Dreaming = traveling, change to mode of awareness 
	- In the dream state, the self is a creator; dream state is handling the materials of the mind, inc. materials from previous lives
		- *All experiences leave an impression* - this is why, in asceticism, it is crucial to pay attention to what your mind is drawn to and to cultivate good thoughts
	- Self ≠ mind 
- Dream state is handling waking experiences at a more fine-grained level, refined, subtler 
- The intensity of light, "hyperreal" quality of dreams, brightness of dreams: it is our light of consciousness, the inner light; a necessary/preconditn to *all* experience, incl. consc. 

**King Janaka**
Offering 1000 cows
Pressing Yaj. 

- Stream/flow between waking and sleeping - "fish going back and forth," eagle perching
- Affinity btw. dreaming and memory 
	- See later: "stream of consc." from psych/phil William James, 19th c. & Freud, modernist literature
		- Upan. is first place this idea is seen in world literature
- Made explicit by **Shankara** in *780 CE*–1000 years later–that there is not a distinction between waking/dreaming states; interpenetration, fractal. 
	- Lucid dreaming, daydreaming, any kind of thought that isn't regarding the here and now is the mind considering its own material 

**Waking, dreaming, and third state:** *Dreamless sleep, deep sleep* 
- When the eagle stops flying and perches: *dreamless sleep is alert and watchful* → this becomes a debate throughout Indian philosophy, if dreamless sleep is a blackout state or if there is consciousness present
	- Do you make an inference that you were asleep based on how you feel when you wake, or is it necessary that your consciousness is online in order to make that inference 
		- Cognitive processing offline but consciousness present, no explicit memory but you can retain lingering feeling
	- %% is there a distinct kind/state/form of memory for emotion in this way? %%
- Dreamless state: no subj/obj. structure, even more *inward*–to core of self–than dreaming state 

> Here a father is not a father, a mother is not a mother, worlds are not worlds, gods are not gods, and Vedas are not Vedas. Here a thief is not a thief, an abortionist is not an abortionist, an outcaste is not an outcaste, a pariah is not a pariah, a recluse is not a recluse, and an ascetic is not an ascetic. Neither the good nor the bad follow him, for he has now passed beyond all sorrows of the heart. p. 60-61

**Death**
> “Now, as this self  (atman)  grows steadily weaker and begins to lose consciousness, these vital functions  (prana)  throng around him. **Taking into himself these particles of light, he descends back into the heart**. When the person connected with sight turns back, the man loses his ability to perceive visible forms.  2   So people say: "He's sinking; he can't see!"—"He's sinking; he can't smell!"—"He's sinking; he can't taste!"—"He's sinking; he can't speak!"—"He's sinking; he can't hear!"—"He's sinking; he can't think!"—"He's sinking; he can't feel a touch!"— "He's sinking; he can't perceive!" Then the top of his heart lights up, **and with that light the self exits through the eye or the head or some other part of the body**. As he is departing, his lifebreath  (prana)  departs with him. **And as his lifebreath departs, all his vital functions  (prana)  depart with it.**”

> “It is like this. As a caterpillar, when it comes to the tip of a blade of grass, reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it, so the self  (atman),  after it has knocked down this body and rendered it unconscious, reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it.”

Brahman; state of being, of same nature as consciousness

*Rebirth*
- Consciousness is not extinguished

> “What a man turns out to be depends on how he acts and on how he conducts himself.”

**Act/action = karma (lit. translation)**
- The reward/punishment is the *result* of karma

> “A man resolves in accordance with his desire, acts in accordance with his resolve, and turns out to be in accordance with his action."

Acts come from *desire*
What you are is what you do, including your *mental actions*; mind acts before body

→ Buddha rejects caste structure

What drives the cycle of life/death/rebirth? *Desire*
→ Buddha works with but rearticulates this

> “Now, a man who does not desire—who is without desires, who is freed from desires, whose desires are fulfilled, whose only desire is his self—his vital functions  (prdna)  do not depart. Brahman  he is, and to  brahman  he goes.”

Liberation requires purification from desire
We get a taste of it, of ego dissolution, in sleep 

Problem: existence in rebirth cosmology 
Solution: liberation, which we have some access to but must purify in order to fully access
