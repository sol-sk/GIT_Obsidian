**SHORT ANSWER QUESTION**  
Answer the following based on the paper we read by Harada et al., 2020, which used fMRI to examine  
questions related to face perception and race/culture, as well what you know from lecture material  
about the paper (30 points).  

- **A. What was the big-picture question that motivated the study? (1 pt total)**  

- **B. Background (6 pts total)**  
	- *I. Describe one thing that previous research, described in the Introduction of the paper, has taught us about the influence of culture on responses to facial emotion and one set of findings described in the paper that support that knowledge. Your answer for the  second part of this question (about the set of findings) should elaborate on your answer  in the first part of this question. (4 pts)* 
	- Previous studies have shown in-group affects on bilateral amygdala response. 
	- *II. What two self-construal styles have been identified by cultural psychologists and what are the main characteristics of each? (2 pts)*  
- **C. Research Questions and Hypotheses (3 pts total)**  
	- *I. What was the main research question? (1 pt)*  
	- Bicultural (Japanese American) individuals would show greater amygdala response to Japanese faces than Caucasian Americans, and collectivistic tendencies would be related to neural responses of intergroup negative facial expression
	- *II. What were two hypotheses put forward by the authors? (2 pts)*  
	- 
- **D. Methods (2 pts total)**  
	- *I. How did they define group membership? (1 pt)*  
	- *II. What was the purpose of the shape stimuli? (1 pt)*  
- **E. Results (4 pts total)**  
	- *I. What was the main pattern of findings for the amygdala? What patterns of brain  activity reflected the “cultural in-group effect?” (2 pts)*  
	- *II. What pattern of brain activity did they find in one particular group of participants when  they looked at the whole brain? (2 pts)*  
- **F. Discussion (4 pts total)**  
	- *I. How do they interpret the midline cortical findings observed in one particular group? (2  pts)*  
	- *II. Was their hypothesis about individual differences supported? Why or why not? (2 pts)*  
- **G. Conclusions and limitations (6 pts total)**  
	- *I. How do they describe the overall meaning and importance of the results? (2 pts)*  
	- *II. List TWO limitations of the study and explain why they are limitations. (4 pts)*  
- **H. In YOUR opinion (4 pts total)**  
	- *I. What are the larger cultural or societal implications of these findings? Do you agree  with the authors’ conclusions? Why or why not? What do you think is important that  they didn’t think of? (4 pts*
