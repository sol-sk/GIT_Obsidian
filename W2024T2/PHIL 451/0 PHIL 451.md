- Mental causation
	- Mental content/"aboutness"
- Consciousness
	- Antiphysicalism
		- Dualism
		- Mysterianism
		- Illusionism
		- Panpsychism
			- Idealism

#### Enlightenment
**Physicalism/Materialism**
- Proposition that both terrestrial and astronomical phenomena can be explained by the same laws (physics) → some (inc. Hobbes) conclude that all natural phenomena can be described by mathematical physics; *everything is physical*
	- Hobbes - first to articulate a computational theory of thought
**Dualism (& broadly, antiphysicalism)**
- Descartes
- Scientists/humans (*beings with minds*) 'systematically elude physical explanation'
- Bodies are governed by mechanical laws, minds are not

**Physicalist strategies**
- *Causation
- If our mental states affect the physical world (ie. a thought leads to an action), they must be physical

**Antiphysicalist strategies**
What can't we explain in physical/mechanistic terms?
- *Content*: aka intentionality, mental representation
	- How can a mental state represent things other than themselves? 
	- (What it is that you love, where it is that you go, etc. Some debate about if intentionality is a quality of all mental states or not)
- *Consciousness*: aka qualia - subjective quality, phenomenology
	- Something that we feel and can recognize but not easily verbalize - 'what it's like'
	- Many consider the most puzzling aspect

***What is physicalism?***
Completeness question: What does it mean to say that *everything* is physical? 
Condition question: What counts as physical? What are our criteria?

Physicalism: worldview of science

***What does it mean to say everything is physical?***
#### Physicalism: strict numerical identity, 'Identity Physicalism'
"**Entity**" - most generic word for a 'thing' to avoid categorizing 
All numerical entities are identical to physical entities 
- Metaphysical distinction between *particulars*: object, e.g. piece of chalk, which is individual, unrepeatable, and exists in a specific temporal and spatial period, and *properties*: the ways that it is, color
- Predication of subject = attribution of a property. *Property is repeatable*. *Particular/subject is not*
	- Tokens/types: "a a b" = How many letters? 3 tokens, and 2 types. 
Two kinds of Identity Physicalism
- **Token-Identity Physicalism**: Particulars
	- All actual particulars are physical objects
	- Too strong and too weak
		- Not every concept has to be a physical object
		- Anti-physicalists can still think all particulars are physical; all particulars are physical, and some have nonphysical properties (*Property dual.s* view, of many contemporary dualists - in contrast with Descartes' dualism)
		- *Substance dual.s*; reject token phys. 
			- Things instantiate irreducably nonphysical properties, such as phenomenal properties

- **Type-Identity Physicalism** (also called **Reductive Physicalism**): Properties
	- Every property of an object is a physical property 
	- J.C.C. Smart, 'Sensations and Brain Properties'; the mental property of feeling something, thinking something, is the same as certain physical properties of the brain
		- e.g. *C fiber activation (CFF)* = being in pain, 'neural correlate of pain'
		- Argument from parsimony/simplicity
	- *Reduces* a property to a physical property; a property is nothing but a physical property: metaphysically reduces the experience of pain to a brain state
	- (skipped slide about reductionism)
	- *Multiple realizability argument against reductive physicalism*
		- Example: we come in contact with an alien species, we get along swimmingly, politics, friendships, relationships, now intertwine; then, we do an autopsy and find they have no brain, no physical location for all the emotions they express: do you now discount all emotions they showed as not real? 
		- Octopi similar: far different brains, but show mentality (thought, emotional (?sort of?) reactions)
		- Relationship between mental and physical is not 1:1, other materials/mental states can be associated with things like pain in other creatures

# 01.14.25 Lecture 3 Supervenience
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 2.pdf]] cont. 
**Supervenience**, supervenience physicalism

#### Multiple Realizability Argument cont.
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 2.pdf#page=14&selection=0,43,2,21|PHIL451 002 - Lecture 2, page 14]] onward
- Mostly review from end of last class
- Not identity but realization

We now want a definition of physicalism will be broad enough to encompass Reductive and Nonreductive Physicalism but narrow enough to exclude Property Dualism. → 
#### Nonreductive Physicalism
**(Role) Functionalism** (*func.s*) most well-known version
- Mistake to identify psyc. states w/ phys. states
	- Hardware realizes software, runs it, but are not same: software can be implemented in diff. phys. systems
- Mental states such as pain = *Second order functional role property* aka. higher order properties
	- Having some property which plays a certain role
	- Describing mental states as input/output profiles, computational roles

> “Pain is the property of having some property or other that realizes the PAIN role”

- Func.s would not necessarily describe pain as realized phys.y
But, can we describe phenomenological experiences? 
But, if pain is something other than CFF, aren't we straying to dualism 

#### Metaphysical supervenience
Serat example
Psyc. prop. are nothing but high level patterns of complex dist. of phys. prop. 
If you change the rules/global properties, you change the realizations. If two things have the same properties, they have the same realization, and vice versa

**Supervenience physicalism (SP)** aka *Minimal physicalism*
> Physical properties to mental properties have the same relationship as dots in painting to global properties of painting (patterns in dots, matrix which dictates where dots are/aren't)

Physicalism is true IFF any world that is a minimal physical duplicate is a duplicate *simpliciter* aka *perfect duplicate*
 → Minimal physical duplicate is identical and has nothing other than what world has/nothing in addition
 - Therefore, everything in our world *supervenes* on the physical

If **SP** is true: A minimal physical duplicate is a mental/psychological duplicate of our world

**SP** classifies **nonreductive phys./role func.s** and **reductive/type idenity phys.** as a version of physicalism: 
- Nonreductive: mental properties metaphysically supervene on physical properties, they are distinct
- Reductive: every property (trivially) supervenes on itself
**SP** avoids problems w/ **token phys.**
- Supreme court of canada isn't an object, but it metaphysically supervenes on physical objects

**Property dualists** reject the claim that mental prop. *metaphysically* supervene on phys. properties
- They would say that a minimal phys. dup. would not necessarily be fully identical because there is something extra on top of physics that make our world unique

**SP** allows for physicalism to be false, in other worlds. 
"Modal" defn.: a definition in terms of how mental properties and physical properties covary across possible worlds
- But, doesn't explain exact nonmodal relation "in virtue of which the two sets of properties modally covary."

**SP:** ***Mental properties are realized by physical properties*** 

# 01.16.25 Lecture 4 Continuum of Physicalism
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 3.pdf]]

#### Continuum of physicalism
**Least → Most physicalist** 
Substance dualism → property dualism → nonreductive physicalism → reductive physicalism

**Substance dualism**
Descartes
Mind = nonphysical
*Substantivalism*
- minds = substance/object, aka soul/spirit: there is a thing that is a mind, which bears mental properties
*Immaterialism*
- minds are wholly mental and nonphysical
*Property non-identity*
- mental properties are numerically distinct from physical properties

Substance dualists reject token & type & supervenience physicalism

**Property dualism**
Substantivalism is false; physical brain has mental properties, but they are wholly nonphysical 
- Upholds property non-identity
- Consistent with token physicalism, rejects type & supervenience

**Nonreductive physicalism**
Supervenience is true but mental properties are numerically distinct because they are "higher order" (*not* because they are fundamentally nonphysical)
- Embrace multiple realizability 
- Rejects type but consistent with token physicalism
- Affirms property nonidentity: differs from property dualism on supervenience

**Reductive physicalism**
Strict identity: Supervenience is true and mental properties are strictly numerically identical with (first order) physical properties
- Accepts token and type physicalism, rejects property nonidentity

#### "Everything is physical" - *The Condition Question*
**[[Stoljar - Physicalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|Stoljar]]**: Completeness question and Condition question 
**[[Montero - (2002) The Body Problem.pdf|Montero]]**

##### Defining the physical
**Proposal 1: Ostensive definition**
> Point at a rock. See it? That’s something physical! (see Montero 2002, p. 184

But physicisists talk about weird little particles that are also physical 

# 01.21.25 Lecture 5 Montero 
[[Montero - (2002) The Body Problem.pdf]] 
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 3.pdf#page=9|PHIL451 002 - Lecture 3, page 9]]

**Proposal 2: Definition by negation**
Criterion of the non-physical/immaterial 

**Proposal 3: Definition by deference - ask the physicists**
"Hempel's Dilemma": do we define microphysical by current physics or by future unspecified physics
- Horn 1: Physicalism can't be defined on current physics because we definitely don't know everything
- Horn 2: Physicalism can't be defined on future physics because the proposal is too vague 
	- Vacuous/trivial

Montero says the fundamental stake is whether any aspect of the mental is fundamental 

*Montero's alternative:* 
Physicalists would appear to be motivated by the following picture: 
(i) There is a fundamental level of reality, comprising various fundamental objects instantiating various fundamental properties/relations and behaving in accord with various fundamental laws. 
(ii) Everything that exists is either fundamental or ‘nothing over and above’ something at the fundamental level. 
(iii) Mentality exists, but not at the fundamental level. 
(iv) Thus, mentality is somehow nothing over and above something at the fundamental level. 
- If this picture is correct, then mentality is like chemical bonding or DNA replication or the weather or currency inflation— perfectly real but not fundamental (as entities like quarks and leptons might be fundamental).

>[[Seager_Consciousness and physicalism.pdf#page=7&selection=0,0,2,2|Seager Theories of Consciousness, pp. 13-17]]

**Two broad ways to use causal efficacy of the mental to attack a metaphysical account of mind**

Unemployment analogy: mental events *unsuited* to do causal work (unqualified)
Or, mental events *have no causal work* to do (no job openings)


Physical → mental 
- Ie. experiencing sensation, pain
Mental → physical 
- Ie. deciding to do an action

Descartes thought that in order to have a relation, there must be contact: but, how can the immaterial soul "contact" the physical? 

#### Papineau: The case for reductive physicalism?
> *Abstract*
> The basic causal argument for materialism is that since physics is causally complete, conscious states must either be physical, or they must be epiphenomenal “danglers” with no causal influence on the physical world. Papineau explores this argument in detail, paying particular attention to the concept of causation, the meaning of “physical”, the relevance of functionalism and other versions of nonreductive physicalism, and the status of the claim that physics is causally closed

***Papineau's causal argument for physicalism: Three claims/premises***
- **(1) Efficacy:** Mental events sometimes sufficiently cause physical events (in virtue of their mental properties)
	- Mental acts have physical effects
- **(2) Completeness** *(aka, causal closure of the physical)***:** Every physical event has a fully sufficient physical cause
	- Physical universe = closed system
- **(3) No systematic overdetermination:** Physical effects of mental causes are not systematically causally overdetermined – they do not systematically have more than one fully sufficient cause
	- Death by firing squad: Death is causally overdetermined because there's no way of knowing which bullet killed him 
- **(bonus) Exclusion:** No effect has more than one sufficient cause unless it is causally overdetermined
	- Papineau does not make explicit but Bennett does

***What does it mean to deny these?***
**Deny efficacy:** Reject 'Alexander's dictum': to be is to have causal powers. Intentional agency ceases to meaningfully exist
**Deny no systematic overdetermination:** Treat all mental-physical causation as "death by firing squad"–It seems (to many) extremely implausible that mental→physical causation is systematically/pervasively overdetermined
**Deny exclusion:** To deny that an event's having more than one sufficient cause is by itself sufficient for being causally overdetermined

Papineau isn't very explicit about his argument, but can be interpreted as *rejecting* **distinctness**
- That mental properties are distinct from physical properties

# 01.28.25 Lecture 7 Bennett - Causal Exclusion 

> [!example] HW
> Schedule: Gibb, “Defending Dualism”
> Lecture: Bennett, [[Bennett - Exclusion again.pdf|“Exclusion Again”]] 

[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 5.pdf]]
*Review*
Let p stand for some behavior
For every p there is a mental event m that causes p 
$\forall p, m \rightarrow p$
m = p* (previous physical event)
Completeness clause (Papineau): Every physical event has a fully sufficient physical cause

#### Bennett
Reject exclusion (rather than distinctness), uphold efficacy, completeness, no systematic overdetermination

> How does an event have multiple distinct causes but not be causally overdetermined?

**Explanation in logic (slightly diff symbols from previously**
e = effect
m = mental cause
p = physical cause

##### Counterfactual argument

$\square \rightarrow$ = "counterfactually implies"
material conditional vs counterfactual conditional
SIM = "similar"

Counterfactual conditionals are vacuously true whenever they have an impossible antecedent 

$$P ~□→ Q~~iff~~\forall w(SIM(P(w)) → Q(w)$$

If no one is drinking alcohol, we don't need to worry that they are 19: it is *vacuously true* that they are obeying the law

"nearest possible worlds"= worlds that are as similar to ours as possible, except that p is true
- Counterfactual is true if in all of these worlds, q is also true

# 01.30.25 Lecture 8 Bennett cont. 


> [!example] HW
> [[Bennett - Exclusion again.pdf]]


#### Overdeterminacy
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 5.pdf#page=15&selection=2,0,2,3|PHIL451 002 - Lecture 5, page 15]]
**(O1)** If m had happened without p, e would still have happened: (m & ¬p) □→ e. 
**(O2)** If p had happened without m, e would still have happened: (p & ¬m) □→ e.

- The upshot (according to Bennett): whichever way you define “causal sufficiency”, nonreductive physicalists have a plausible way to claim that O2 is either vacuously true or false

# 02.06.25 Lecture 9/10 Gibb on Completeness
 9 cancelled for snow 
 [[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 6.pdf]]
 [[Gibb - (2015) Defending dualism.pdf]]

Gibb's "exclusion" is completely diff. from Bennett's lol

Gibb feels that Completeness is not well argued for by most physicalists

Recall Papineau’s Causal Argument for Physicalism (or Gibb’s reconstruction of it on p. 365) 
1. Mental causes have physical effects. Efficacy. 
2. Every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause. Completeness.
3. There is no systematic causal overdetermination. No Systematic Overdetermination.

Therefore: 
4. Mental causes are identical with physical causes

#### Papineau
##### Papineau's argument for Completeness
1. Every physical system is "conservative"; law of conservation of energy 
2. There is probably no non-physical energy 
Therefore: 
1. Probably, every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause (Completeness)

##### Notes on Premise 1 (Conservation)
- Physical conservation laws are "silent" about what forms of energy exist-are only about the magnitude of energy in system conserved 
- Conservation is, in principle, consistent with the existence of fundamentally non-physical/"psychic" energy 

##### Notes on Premise 2 (Energy)
- "Argument from fundamental forces": we have strong evidence that all "high-level" forces and energy 'reduce to' lower-level forces/energy 
	- We can break everything down into physics/smaller parts
	- In history of science, we have always found the things behind "irreducable forces": everything reduces
- "Argument physiology": if fundamental, irreducible forces do exist, we would have found evidence for their existence by now: so, they likely don't exist

#### Gibb
Papineau's argument is stronger than just "Completeness":
- Not just, "every physical effect has a physical cause" - *No physical effect has a non-physical cause*: She calls this **exclusion** (Gibb exclusion, **G.Exc**)

***Preliminary***
If she's correct, this completely changes the game for the traditional physicalist argument
- Systematic overdetermination out of the picture because now there's no overdetermination

(*Q: is G.Exc = reductive phys? A: seems like yes (he's not 100% sure)*)

##### Main point: Papnieau's argument is invalid
Substituting Completeness for **G.Exc**:
1. Every physical system is conservative or is part of a larger system that is conservative. Conservation 
2. There is (probably) no non-physical energy. Energy
Therefore: 
3. Probably, no physical effect has a non-physical cause. Gibb-Exclusion

**Red flag:** "cause" appears *only in the conclusion*

Gibb proposes we **add** at least two premises: 
- **Physical affectability (PA)**: 
	- The only way that non-phys affects phys is by *1) affecting* or *2) redistributing* the amt. of energy/momentum w/in it
- **Redistribution (Reb)**: 
	- You can't redistribute energy/momentum w/o supplying energy/momentum

Gibb argues the case for these premises is not easy to make as either physics or metaphysics. She suggests some proposals that would support PA/Reb:
- *Transference*: causation is the transference of a quantity from cause to effect, where this quantity is energy/momentum 
	- Gibb: this makes conservation redundant, & if we replace conservation w/ transference, we still have to interpret the *scope* of transference (narrow-physical causation, or broad-all causation? either way, we end up back at G.Exc)
- *There is empirical support for PA and Reb that dualists are ignorant of*
	- Gibb: No, there isn't
- *Psychophys. causation becomes unintelligible if we deny PA*
	- I hate this slide
	- Nomological/regularity
	- Counterfactual theories


# 02.11.25 Lecture 11

#### Gibbs con.t
Interactionist dualism, not standard dualism

**Suzy and Billy are piloting fighter jets in WW3**
- Billy shoots down the enemy that would have shot down Suzy, thereby allowing her to execute the scheduled bombing
	- Double prevention: he prevents her from being prevented 
	- Negate the negation ahahahshshahahahaha

→ Objection to theories of causation that would imply double preventor is the cause
- But, billy has important causal role!!!!!!!!!
- Counterfactual dependence


Powers theory of causation
- Objects have powers/dispositions, which, under certain conditions, can be manifested
	- Aristotlean 

Gibbs: mental events are double preventors 
- Ie. multiple physical pathways that could unfold: mental events affect which, without transferring energy to them

**Brentano's thesis**:  *all and only mental states have intentionality.* 

'Original' vs 'Derived' intentionality
- Haugeland, Searle

Amendment to Brentano → *Only things that have original, non-derived intentionality are mental states* 
Derivatively, we attribute meaning to words

Intentionality; taking aim at something

#### **'Direction of fit'**
- All intentional mental states can be satisfied/successed/fulfilled/enacted
- Type of intentional state distinguished by characteristic standard of success aka *direction of fit*
	- Mind-to-world - truth, accuracy, correctness
	- World-to-mind - fulfillment, enactment, action-guidance
	- Hybrid - both at once (fear? percceiving and repsonding to environment)
		- "push-me-pull-you"

#### **Representational theory of intentionality**
To aaron, so ingrained that he feels these are synonymous
- Intentional mental state = a mental representation
	- Dominant tradition
- Intentional directedness = the representational content of a mental representation
Brief history
- Early modern period (Locke, Hume)
	- 'Images', 'ideas'
- Introspectionist psych
	- Overthrown by behaviorism
- Post-behavrst computational cogsci
	- Intentional behavr is effect of internal computation of symbols
	- Representatins effective bc of their syntax/shape
	- Physically implemented via neural states/processes
	- No necessary connectn w consciousness and introspectn 

##### Wilfred Sellars' myth of jones
- Intentional psych as "folk theory" - mental states are only speculated upon from outside, to predict/explain behavior of other agents/oneself
##### Willard Van Orman Quine 
- Underdetermination of a theory by its data 
	- Any theory you form about what people mean is undetermined by evidence; you can never fully prove exactly what is meant
- no purely extensional account of intentionality 
- Eliminativism about intentional phenom
- Skeptical of meaning in general
	- We should not make the assumption that words have a determinate meaning because its fundamentally indeterminate - skeptical about intentional phenomena


#### Interpretivism and Intentional systems theory
"Intentional systems theory" rejects original/derived intentionlaity
- Anchors intentionality to 3rd person perspective of an *interpreter* (dennett, davidson)
Content of thoughts is from most charitable rational interpretation of a person's behavior
Normative standard of rationality
Intentional states aren't unobservable internal states; they are observable patterns
Not speculating about domain of hidden facts

Basically same as behavrsm tbh

Nothing more than engaging in pattern of behavior which is logically rationally consistnet: no difference between genuinely believing and seeming to believe

→ is this not anti-realist or instrumentalist?

Intentional stance allows us to make long term predictions –

[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 9.pdf]]
### Concepts of consciousness

**Creature consciousness:** Consciousness as a property of a creature/organism/person; being conscious

**State consciousness:** Consciousness as a property of a mental state; having a conscious experience 

> [!NOTE] 03.11.25 begins;
>  [[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 9.pdf#page=4|PHIL451 002 - Lecture 9: Concepts of consciousness - Varieties of state consciousness]]

#### Varieties of state consciousness (4)
Some states are accessible; some are not 
Can't access V1, but can "access" visual representations
11:03 started recording: slide 4 - review of *types of state consciousness*

- *Access consciousness*: mental state avail for free use in global control of action (explicit reasoning, verbal report, intentional action)
- *Self-consciousness*: mental state that represents oneself as such - "tokens of the first person indexical 'I'"
- *Monitoring consciousness*: mental state one is conscious of - consciousness of a mental state as such
- *Affective consciousness*: mental state that possesses a hedonic tone or affective 'valence'
- *Phenomenal consciousness*: mental state there is something it is like for the subject to have/be in. The phenomenal character of such a state is how it 'feels' or 'what it is like'

##### Phenomenal consciousness (5)
- Primary point of philosophical controversy -- "hard problem of consciousness"
- Phenom character can be subdiv.d into 2 dimensions: *qualitative* (what it is like) and *subjective* ("for-me-ness," something that it is like to be you)

##### Phenomenal vs access?  (6)
- putative (generally considered to be)
- Funct.lst proposal 
- Contents of awareness that are outside attention; remains phenomenal but isn't really access 
	- Peripherally hearing jackhammer during engrossing convo, "Sperling partial report paradigm" (controversial!)
- Access consciousness w/o phenom. consciousness 
	- "super-blindsight" - blindsight + unprompted use 
		- Someone who can access blindsight spontaneously 
		bruh why are u talking about dorsal ventral visual system 
		- Theories that ventral is only conscious accessed one? -- blindsight is ventral lesion 
- Block's "methodological challenge" for a scientific theory of consciousness: how to scientifically investigate
	- Can we investigate phenom without presupposing that phenom = access? 
	- *Sperling partial report* - secret bonus slide:
		- ![[IMG_9616.jpeg]]
		- Cue tone; report all letters - Not able to report all 9 letters after brief exposure
		- Cue tone; report *top/middle/bottom* row - they can accurately report whichever *row* is cued
			- Can't report all, but can report specific row 
		- → we visually experience the entire array but we can only consciously access a subset of them → access ≠ phenom. consciousness 
	- Block: *GWS fail* as theories of phenom. bc they link phenom w/ central cogn

![[IMG_9617.jpeg|400x500]]
- ![[Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 11.41.39 AM.png|200]]
- Immersion and flow states; phenomenally conscious that seem to occur w/o "self"/self-monitoring
- When ppl act in flow, they sometimes report losing self despite remaining consciously present & in control
	- Flow state = losing yourself → meditation, Confucianism connection
	- Sleepwalking and the illusion? of intentional action

##### Connecting phenom character and representational content (7) ~11:55
Indicator teleosemantics seems to have given us a beginning explanation of mental representations
- Some philosophers – ‘reductive representationalists’ – aim to provide a broadly ‘reductive’ account of phenomenal character in terms of representational content. 
- In particular, such philosophers claim to give a two-step reductive explanation of phenomenal consciousness: 
	- Step #1: reductively explain the phenomenal character of a conscious state in terms of a certain kind of representational content; 
	- Step #2: reductively explain the representational content of a mental state in terms of some unproblematically causal notion (e.g., tracking relations).  


##### Accounting for subjective character *reductively* (8) 12:03
*First order vs higher order theories (also in 351)*
**First order theories
- Reduction of phenom. consciousness to access consciousness 
- PANIC theory
	- "Poised" for uptake by cognition → phenom conscious 
	- Global workspace theory
**Higher order theories (Higher order thought theory HOTT)**
- Reduction of *phenom* consciousness to *monitoring* consciousness (e.g., meta-representation)
- Some mental reps are of being in a state
- Some are about being in a state: HOTs
	- Conscious state = state you are conscious of being in

Major disagreement: phenom & metaphys structure of consciousness - different theoretical weight given to *transparency* & *transitivity* 
- Transparency = world-directedness/outer awareness
- Transitivity = self-directedness/inner awareness
*Introspective-phenomenological theses predate this reductionist debate*

***Transparency (‘Diaphanousness')***
> "[T]hough philosophers have recognised that something distinct is meant by consciousness, they have never yet had a clear conception of what that something is ... [T]he moment we try to fix our attention upon consciousness and to see what, distinctly, it is, it seems to vanish: it seems as if we had before us a mere emptiness. When we try to introspect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue: the other element is as if it were *diaphanous*.” (Moore 1903)

### Kripke vs Reductive Physicalism
Kripke's argument against reductive physicalism/type identity -- many consider it a "sophisticated resurrection" of Descartes' argument
#### Historical context
##### Descartes' *Conceivability argument:*
- P1. I can clearly and distinctly conceive of my mind existing without my body existing (or without anything else physical existing). (see Meditation 2 where Descartes is in the grips of hyperbolic doubt) 
- P2. Whatever is clearly and distinctly conceivable is metaphysically possible. 
- C1. It is possible for my mind to exist without my body existing (or without anything else physical existing). 
- C2. *My mind is not my body (or anything else physical)*

"Good day in the armchair"

Mind is not numerically identical to body 

Conceivability argument → what is "clear and distinct conceiving?"

##### Smart: Conceivable/Contingent
**Smart argues that C2 doesn't follow from C1**; merely **contingently** true 
> In general, the negation of an empirically established identity statement is perfectly conceivable, and (maybe) metaphysically possible... 
> But the identity statements are nevertheless perfectly true. Likewise, Smart proposed, for the identity theorist’s identification of mental state-types with brain state-types

Water = H20 *contingently*; metaphysically, could theoretically be different in another universe

#### Kripke
##### Technical background
**The necessity of identity**
- Any object "o" is identical to itself
- Rigid designator versus non-rigid: "prime minister" can refer to different people/things, versus "Justin Trudeau"

##### Naming and necessity
If "A" and "B" are both rigid designators, with the same referent, then if "A" = "B" is true, it is true necessarily

→ Scientific identities like water = H20 are *necessarily* true (not *contingent*)
→ Pain = CFF necessarily, by rigid designation
- Science strives for necessary truths, which can be established only *a posteriori*; via empirical evidence
- H20 is *underlying essence* of water, to Kripke (hot take!)

Challenges **Humean** distinction:
between **relation of ideas** 
(analytic, true by definition, knowable *a priori* without empirical obsv.n, *necessary*) 
and **matter of fact** 
(*a posteriori*, synthetic–not derivable only by definition, must be synthesized, *contingent*)

**Kripke** says there are mixed combinations between these categories; necessary a posteriori, contingent a priori

**Kripke on C1-C2**
- The move from C1 to C2 in Cartesian conceivability argument is *valid*
- "Prime minister" is a *definite description*, referring to diff obj. in diff. possible worlds -- "my mind" and "my body" are both *rigid*

**The Descartes-Kripke modal argument** 
- (P1) It is conceivable that pain is not identical with CFF. 
- (P2) If it is conceivable that x ≠ y, then it is possible that x ≠ y. 
- (C1) It is possible that pain is not identical with CFF. 
- (**P3**) If it is possible that x ≠ y, then x ≠ y. 
- (C2) Pain is not identical with CFF.

- P1 seems plausible on its face. It certainly seems as if there could be pain in the absence of CFF and vice versa. As Kripke says, the connection between pain and CFF “appears contingent” or non- necessary. 
- P2 expresses the plausible-seeming view that conceivability is a reliable guide to metaphysical possibility. 
- P3 follows from the necessity of identity, and C2 follows from P3 together with: 
	- (i) Kripke’s claim that “pain” and “CFF” are rigid designators and 
	- (ii) his proof that identities involving rigid designators are necessarily true (if true at all). - And each inference in the argument is valid

Recording starts 11:04

Pain = CFF
Heat = MMM (mean molecular motion)

11:19 - Kripke's reply
- Actually, pain = CFF is in a very diff category to MMM, H2O
- If you try to imagine a world where water ≠ H2O, heat ≠ MMM, you are no longer imagining water or heat -- diff substances which give rise to the same experience
	- We know about water, heat, via our experience of them
- CFF: Talking about experience itself, rather than the substance that gives rise to that experience

### The knowledge argument and the zombie argument
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 11.pdf]]
[[PHIL451 002 - Lecture 12 (a priori physicalism).pdf]]

11:59

#### Knowledge argument
**Jackson's "Epiphenomenal Qualia"**
- Physicalism (defined as "all {correct} information is physical information") is false 
- A minimal physical duplicate (goes on to also disagree w/ supervenience physicalism) would not be identical

**The Knowledge Argument**
P1: Mary knows all physical facts
C1: If physicalism is true, Mary knows all physical facts
P2: After her release, Mary learns something (qualia) that she couldn't have known in the black and white room 
P3: If Mary learns something, she learns a new fact
C2: After her release, Mary learns a new fact
C3: Physical facts do not exhaust all facts → physicalism is false

Why does C1 follow from P1? Bc of his understanding of physicalism; **controversial**!

**The zombie argument**
Traces back to Descartes
Chalmers
Physicalism is false bc zombies are conceivable; physically identical, phenomenally bankrupt
P1: It is conceivable that there be zombies 
P2: if it is conceivable, it is metaphysically possible
P3: If it is metaphysically possible there be zombies, physicalism is false 
C: physicalism is false

P1: P conceivable IFF not-P is not a priori; not a priori that there are no zombies, so there could be
P2: If zombies conceivable, they are metaphysically possible in some broad sense
P3: If zombies are metaphysically possible, then P → ~Q. If P → ~Q, ~(P → Q)







fucking Mary

hope you enjoyed my participation

Diff distinctions; 
did she learn a new skill or new fact? distinction between knowledge of and knowledge that?

### Section one from [[PHIL451 - practice set for final exam (2025).pdf]]
##### Explaining the thesis of physicalism requires an answer to both the ‘completeness question’ and the ‘condition question’. What are these two questions?
Physicalist: "everything is physical"
- To philosopher of mind; this includes the mind

Stoljar:
- **Completeness**
	- *Everything* is physical
- **Condition**
	- Everything is *physical* 

Supervenience addresses completeness question

##### Explain the thesis of supervenience/minimal physicalism
A minimal physical duplicate is identical (is a "duplicate *simpliciter*")
		- Mental is "weakly emergent" upon the physical; a higher level pattern
			- Doesn't require mental properties to be numerically identical to physical 


##### “Physicalists claim that the mind is physical”. Does this provide an adequate formulation of physicalism? Why or not why?
 Anti-physicalists can still think all particulars are physical; all particulars are physical, and some have nonphysical properties (*Property dual.s* view, of many contemporary dualists - in contrast with Descartes' dualism)

##### Drawing on the notion of supervenience, explain how non-reductive physicalism and property dualism differ
Nonreductive physicalists (NRP) do say that mental and physical properties aren't the same – isn't this property dualist?
Both would think that pain ≠ CFF 
- NRP think there is a more "robust" relationship; physical still entails mental 
- *The difference between NRP and prop dualist is endorsement of supervenience*
Property dualist wouldn't think duplicate simpliciter is identical
##### What is the standard motivation for being a ‘non-reductive’ physicalist?
Mental property could be higher order, and therefore **multiply realizable** 
Physicalists would just emphasize that it is realized physically 
***(recording on phone from 11:30 onward)***
e.g. pain with the martian, octopus 

##### Describe one way that a non-reductive physicalist might develop the claim that mental properties metaphysically supervene on physical properties. (Note: we discussed some candidate proposals in the course of discussing Karen Bennett’s contribution to the mental causation debate).
2 diff ways of determining between a high and low level property: 
Scarlet is a determinate way of being red because red is instantiated in virtue of being scarlet
- We can order properties in terms of how abstract, or determinate, they are
- Likewise, mental properties are always instantiated in terms of some physically determinate property
Mental properties correspond to causal subset of physical 
- any 2 distinct realizations will overlap in certain causal powers: this overlap constitutes the mental property
** he wont ask this cause this kind of question sucksss - too granular 

##### Type A vs type B
physical entails psychological (P → Q) -- is it a priori? or not? 
- As in, could you get Q if you had all P? 
A: P is "epistemically transparent"
- "hardcore functionalists"
B: while P is metaphys suff., you can't a priori deduce

*{my answer}:*
a priori believes that *all* truths about the universe entail from physical laws; mary does in fact know everything before she leaves the room 
- dennett
a posteriori: there are some truths about the universe which do not entail even from a full set of physical facts 
- accept the existence of explanatory gap
- balog
- papineau


type a tend to be non-reductive, hardcore functionalist - no diff in principle between our phenom states and our concepts of heat and lightning - no mystery around functional concepts

type b tend to be more comfortable granting non-functionality about phenom states; but can say that phenom concept is just a mode of presentation of physical, so they are reductively the same -- even if we couldn't arrive at this truth a priori 

##### Hempel's dilemma
What do we mean by physical? Can we use an incomplete definition of physics, or can we use a hypothetically... "complete"? physics that is unproven ?

→ physicalism is either obviously false or trivially true

##### Montero
We can only have this debate about mind-body problem if we have a clear concept of the body– and, as shown by Hempel, we have to concede we don't have a clear concept of the physical/body

-- eliminate word physical and replace with fundamental:
- physicalists are people who think that the mental is *not* a fundamental feature of the universe; it supervenes on the nonmental 
- anti-physicalists, dualists: you can't get the mental out of the non-mental: the mental is fundamental

### Section 2 from [[PHIL451 - practice set for final exam (2025).pdf]]
##### David Papineau offers a ‘causal argument’ for physicalism and against dualism. Explain this argument. (Note: at least one of Papineau’s assumptions is unstated). 


##### The argument you just summarized rests on numerous assumptions. Briefly indicate an intuitive motivation that one might provide for each of those premises.
