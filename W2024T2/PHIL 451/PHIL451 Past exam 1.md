### Section 1: Understanding Physicalism
[[Past 451 final exam.pdf]]
1. *Explain the doctrine of ‘supervenience physicalism’ – a.k.a., ‘minimal physicalism’.*
**Minimal physical duplicate is a complete duplicate/simpliciter**
**physical facts of the world metaphysically necessitate the mental facts**

2. *Supervenience physicalism is best viewed as offering an answer to which question about physicalism:*
	1. *the completeness question (what does it mean to say that everything is physical?)*
	2. *the condition question (what does it mean to say that everything is physical?)*
	3. *the truth question (is physicalism true?)*
**Completeness**

3. *What is the difference between reductive and non-reductive physicalism?*
**Reductive: mental properties are strictly identical, NRP: property non-identity**

4. *Describe the standard motivation for being a ‘non-reductive’ physicalism.*
**multiple realizability – same mental prop diff physical prop**
**reductive incompatible w/ MR bc MR = prop nonidentity**
**NRP uphold phys by asserting that physical states necessitate mental**

**"functional role properties": phys prop have functional role rather than identical**

5. *Do supervenience physicalists take a stand on the debate between reductive and non-reductive physicalism or are they neutral on this question? Explain.*
**Supervenience can be reductive or nonreductive**

6. *Describe a metaphysical possibility that non-reductive physicalism prohibits but that property dualism allows. Your answer should include the notion of supervenience.*
**Zombie world: min phys nonmental, qualia inversion - both violate supervenience**

7. *What is ‘Hempel’s dilemma’ for physicalism?*
**Explaining condition**
**physicalism either false bc:**
- **contemp.y physics is likely either inc. or mistaken** 
- **future phys is too vague to mean anything**

8. *According to Barbara Montero, can one accept Hempel’s dilemma without concluding that centuries of debate over the truth or falsity of physicalism have been a huge waste of time? Explain. (2 marks)*
**No! We can recast phys as questions about the fundamentality of the mental**

### Section 2: Mental causation
1. *Explain David Papineau’s ‘causal argument’ for physicalism (a.k.a., the ‘causal exclusion argument’). (Note: at least one of Papineau’s premises is unstated). (4 marks)*
"Since physics is causally complete, conscious states must either be physical or epiphenomenal"
- Claim 1: Efficacy — mental acts have physical effects 
	- Reject: no more intentional agency/ reject 'alexander's dictum'
- Claim 2: Completeness — physics is a closed system
	- Reject: ? {reject physics?}
- Claim 3: No systematic overdetermination — physical effects of mental causes are not systematically causally overdetermined
	- Reject: treat all mental-physical as death by firing squad; seems implausible
- *bonus- unstated Claim 4: Exclusion* — No effect has more than one sufficient cause unless it is causally overdetermined
	- Reject: denies that event having more than one sufficient cause is sufficient for being causally overdetermined (SCOD)

Papineau *rejects distinctness* aka the thought than mental and phys properties are distinct 
**if we want to uphold the causal sufficiency of a mental event (efficacy), physical event (completeness) and ~SCOD, we must conclude ~Distinctness**

2. *Reasoning for Papineau's claims?*
**same as i wrote before**

3. Why have some philosophers – notably, Jaegwon Kim – regarded the line of reasoning that you just outlined not as an argument for physicalism per se but for a specific, controversial version of physicalism. (2 marks)*
**Rejecting distinctness is type-id: leads to Reductive physicalism**


4. *According to Karen Bennett, who has the correct take on this issue?*
	1. *Kim*
	2. *Papineau*
	3. *Neither*

Neither? 
Bennett is a nonreductive physicalist 
She aligns more with Papineau than Kim
However, differs on what she thinks NRP can reject, from Papineau's 3+1 premises

6. *According to Bennett, which assumption of the causal argument – left unstated in Papineau’s original presentation – are physicalists in a position to reject? (1 mark)*
**Exclusion**. An effect *can* have two distinct causes without being overdetermined

6. *What is the counterfactual conditional that, on Bennett’s view, is either false or vacuously true if physicalism is true. (A counterfactual conditional is a statement of the form ‘had x occurred, then y would have occurred’, where ‘x’ is some nonactual state of affairs.)*
(O1) If m (mental) had happened without p (physical), e (effect) would still have happened: (m & ¬p) □→ e. 
**(O2) If p had happened without m, e would still have happened: (p & ¬m) □→ e.**

7. *Explain why, according to Bennett, dualists – or, at least, dualists who concede the other premises in the causal argument – not able to take the same attitude that physicalists do toward the truth value of this counterfactual.*

**dualists wish to uphold O2 as nonvacuously true**
### Section 3: Naturalizing intentionality/mental representation
1. *What do philosophers of mind mean when they speak of the ‘intentionality’ (a.k.a., the ‘intentional content’ or ‘representational content’) of a mental state? (2 marks)*
**Intuitively, the content of a mental representation is what the representation ‘says’ about the world. It is the ‘condition’ that that reality must satisfy in order for the representation to count as true, accurate, or successful.**

2. *Considered as a type of relation (between the representing system and the represented object), intentionality can seem intuitively puzzling from a physicalist perspective. Give two examples to illustrate why this is so. (2 marks)*
**the apparent lack of causal connection between the two elements of the relation:**

**1. fictional**
**2. remoteness**
**3. sensitivity to description rather than reality**

**→ influence on behavr despite the above**

3. *One way that physicalists have hoped to remove the air of mystery around the representational content of mental states is by regarding it as somehow composed of natural relations like reliable indication. What is ‘reliable indication’, and what might lead one to believe that it could contribute to explaining how mental states represent what they do?*

**reliable indication: conventional vs ubiquitous meaning of a sign**

**Further, there are rudimentary kinds of mental representation which seem like they might be a matter of natural meaning, notably sensory representation and/or sensory recognitional concepts.**

**ie V4**

4. *There are two (closely related) objections to the claim we can explain the content of a mental  representation solely in terms of what the representation reliably indicates (i.e., to the claim that X represents Y if and only if X reliably indicates Y). These are the ‘misrepresentation problem’ and the ‘disjunction problem’. Explain one of these problems, and the explanatory demand that it places on a successful theory of intentional/representational content. (3 marks)*
**problems arise bc rep metaphys. necessitates presence of thing it indicates**
**reliable indication necessary → impossible to misrepresent**
**reliable indication sufficient → disjunctions**

**still don't explain causally distant things**

5. *Some theorists (e.g., Dretske, Millikan, and Neander) argue that we can answer the misrepresentation problem and disjunction problem by appealing to a mental representation’s evolved ‘proper function’ (a.k.a., ‘teleofunction’). Describe one such proposal, and how it claims to overcome the problem you described above. (3 marks)*
**Indicator teleosemantics: X represents Y iff X has the *proper function* of reliably indicating Y.**

6. *Raise an objection to the view you just described. (Your answer should indicate whether the objection targets the specific teleosemantic proposal you described in your answer to the previous question, the whole teleosemantic approach of using proper functions to explain a mental representation’s intentional content, or to the broader physicalist project of attempting to explain intentionality in non-intentional terms). (2 marks)*
**Indicator teleosemantics → functional indeterminacy; teleofunctions deliver highly indeterminate contents**

### Section 4: Phenomenal consciousness
1. *Fill in the blanks of the following argument from Descartes (‘The Conceivability Argument’).*

	*P1. I can clearly and distinctly conceive of my __ existing without my ___ existing.*

	*P2. Whatever is clearly and distinctly conceivable is __.*

	*C1. It is ___ for my ____ to exist without my __ existing.*

	*C2. My `_____` is not my `_____`.*x

2. *Describe the influential objection to Descartes’ conceivability argument associated with the reductive physicalist, J.C.C. Smart. (Note while we did not read Smart’s paper, we discussed it in lecture when introducing Kripke). (3 marks)*
**C2 doesn't follow from C1** 
- **mind body could be contingent**
- **contingent common in sci; water is contingently H2O**

3. *Explain why, according to Kripke, this influential physicalist response to the conceivability argument fails.*


4. *“But a statement like “water is nothing but a collection of H2O molecules” appears contingent. Though the statement is (let us suppose) true, we can easily imagine – or conceive of – it being false.” What is Kripke’s response to this?*

It is actually not contingent!

5. *According to Kripke, could one offer the same analysis for a statement like “pain is nothing but a certain pattern of neural activation (e.g., C-fiber activation or whatever type of neural event is discovered to systematically correlate with subjective reports of pain)”? Explain.*

6. *Explain Frank Jackson’s ‘knowledge argument’ against physicalism.*

7. *What is the specific version of anti-physicalism that Jackson goes on to endorse on the basis of this argument?*
	1. *Interactionist substance dualism (‘Type-D anti-physicalism’)*
	2. *Epiphenomenalism (‘Type-E anti-physicalism’)*
	3. *Russellian monism/panpsychism (‘Type-F monism’)*
	   
8. *Describe the two dominant strategies that physicalists have pursued in response to Jackson’s knowledge argument. (Note: your answer name the different versions of physicalism and specify which premises of the argument the physicalist response attacks).*

9. *Identify one (at least prima facie) reason to prefer one of these versions of physicalism over the other. (Note: either version of physicalism is acceptable, but the motivation that you give for it should be an accurate one).*

10. *BONUS (for 1 mark): Describe one idea that you had not seriously considered prior to taking this class. (You can interpret ‘idea’ broadly to include an observation, a question, a theoretical possibility, etc.) (1 mark)*

11. *BONUS (for 1 mark): In your own view, is there a recurring shortcoming or flaw running through the material that we have studied in this class? (1 mark)*

12. *BONUS (for 1 mark): The topic I enjoyed the MOST was …. And the topic I enjoyed the LEAST was …*

I enjoyed intentionality the most, since it reminded me of semiotics and I think the topic of meaning making and meaning representation is very interesting 

13. *BONUS (for 1 mark): One issue or question that I wish we had discussed (or discussed in more detail than we did) is …*
