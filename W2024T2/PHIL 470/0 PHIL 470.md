> [!example] HW 01.07.25
> Upaniṣads, 28-30, 34-52, 58-71, 171-175.

Interpretations of "Upanisad"
- To sit close beside: secret oral teaching from teacher to disciple
- Connection, equivalence: contains secret knowledge of hidden connections among things → *Atman (true self) + brahman (ultimate source)* = ultimate secret connection
	- Vedanta school believes atman = brahman - nonduality
	- Knowing highest brahamn => becoming highest brahman
	- True knowledge as state of oneness/unity, blending subj & obj.

**In earlier Vedic hymns:**
Brahman = *power contianed in recited words/hymns*
- Est. connection between utterer and cosmos through sound
Atman is vital breath/life essence of human

**In Upanisads:**
Brahman synonymous w/ being while also capturing this power
Atman = self, ultimate essence

### Brhadaranyaka Upanisad (BU)
Dialogue between brahmin sage Yajnavalka (Yaj) and King Janaka of Videha

King asks: **What is the source of light?**
- Sun → moon → fire → voice → *atman*, self
- External → internal outer → inner

Atman exists in both worlds, one waking and one sleeping 
- Dream world is intermediate between waking and death (third world)

#  Lecture 2 01.09.25
~700 BCE, before Greeks
"first text of world philosophy"
### Brhadaranyaka (BU) 4.3-4.4 (pp.58-68), partial recap of Lecture 1
##### Yajnavalkya (abbr. Yaj.)
- Great teacher, sarcastic, irreverent 
- Poking fun at other priests who he interprets as not knowing the meaning of the text
- Defeats 8 brahmins in debate, including the woman Gargi, who is strongest–tells others not to bother once she's been defeated
	- Women in Upan.; patriarchal society, but there are components of it (Gargi, Maitreyi-1st wife of Yaj.), who are portrayed as interested in philosophy, intelligent
- Wives: Maitreyi, Katyayani 
- Eventually leaves society, ascetic way of life 
Tradnl ways of life being undermined, questioning of tradnl. rituals → asceticism, rigorous rituals of mind and body, to find liberation ("original hippies")→ Buddha arises from this 

"Sun rises and sets, the self is always there"
- From outwards to inwards
- The true self shines constant (Fire, light metaphors throughout) - luminosity of true consciousness

**Dreams**
- Dreaming = traveling, change to mode of awareness 
	- In the dream state, the self is a creator; dream state is handling the materials of the mind, inc. materials from previous lives
		- *All experiences leave an impression* - this is why, in asceticism, it is crucial to pay attention to what your mind is drawn to and to cultivate good thoughts
	- Self ≠ mind 
- Dream state is handling waking experiences at a more fine-grained level, refined, subtler 
- The intensity of light, "hyperreal" quality of dreams, brightness of dreams: it is our light of **consciousness, the inner light**; a necessary/preconditn to *all* experience, incl. consc. 

**King Janaka**
Offering 1000 cows
Pressing Yaj. 

- Stream/flow between waking and sleeping - "fish going back and forth," eagle perching
- Affinity btw. dreaming and memory 
	- See later: "stream of consc." from psych/phil William James, 19th c. & Freud, modernist literature
		- Upan. is first place this idea is seen in world literature
- Made explicit by **Shankara** in *780 CE*–1000 years later–that there is not a distinction between waking/dreaming states; interpenetration, fractal. 
	- Lucid dreaming, daydreaming, any kind of thought that isn't regarding the here and now is the mind considering its own material 

**Waking, dreaming, and third state:** *Dreamless sleep, deep sleep* 
- When the eagle stops flying and perches: *dreamless sleep is alert and watchful* → this becomes a debate throughout Indian philosophy, if dreamless sleep is a blackout state or if there is consciousness present
	- Do you make an inference that you were asleep based on how you feel when you wake, or is it necessary that your consciousness is online in order to make that inference 
		- Cognitive processing offline but consciousness present, no explicit memory but you can retain lingering feeling %% is there a distinct kind/state/form of memory for emotion in this way? %%
- Dreamless state: no subj/obj. structure, even more *inward*–to core of self–than dreaming state 

> Here a father is not a father, a mother is not a mother, worlds are not worlds, gods are not gods, and Vedas are not Vedas. Here a thief is not a thief, an abortionist is not an abortionist, an outcaste is not an outcaste, a pariah is not a pariah, a recluse is not a recluse, and an ascetic is not an ascetic. Neither the good nor the bad follow him, for he has now passed beyond all sorrows of the heart. p. 60-61

**Death**
> “Now, as this self  (atman)  grows steadily weaker and begins to lose consciousness, these vital functions  (prana)  throng around him. **Taking into himself these particles of light, he descends back into the heart**. When the person connected with sight turns back, the man loses his ability to perceive visible forms.  2   So people say: "He's sinking; he can't see!"—"He's sinking; he can't smell!"—"He's sinking; he can't taste!"—"He's sinking; he can't speak!"—"He's sinking; he can't hear!"—"He's sinking; he can't think!"—"He's sinking; he can't feel a touch!"— "He's sinking; he can't perceive!" Then the top of his heart lights up, **and with that light the self exits through the eye or the head or some other part of the body**. As he is departing, his lifebreath  (prana)  departs with him. **And as his lifebreath departs, all his vital functions  (prana)  depart with it.**”
> 
> “It is like this. As a caterpillar, when it comes to the tip of a blade of grass, reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it, so the self  (atman),  after it has knocked down this body and rendered it unconscious, **reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it**.”
> pp. 63-64

Brahman; state of being, of same nature as consciousness

*Rebirth*
- Consciousness is not extinguished

> “What a man turns out to be depends on how he acts and on how he conducts himself.”

**Act/action = karma (lit. translation)**
- The reward/punishment is the *result* of karma

> “A man resolves in accordance with his desire, acts in accordance with his resolve, and turns out to be in accordance with his action."

Acts come from *desire*
What you are is what you do, including your *mental actions*; mind acts before body

→ Buddha rejects caste structure

What drives the cycle of life/death/rebirth? *Desire*
→ Buddha works with but rearticulates this

> “Now, a man who does not desire—who is without desires, who is freed from desires, whose desires are fulfilled, whose only desire is his self—his vital functions  (prdna)  do not depart. Brahman  he is, and to  brahman  he goes.”
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=154&selection=19,1,22,22|p.65]] 

*Liberation requires purification from desire:* We get a taste of it, of ego dissolution, in sleep 

*Problem*: existence in rebirth cosmology 
 / *Solution*: liberation, which we have some access to but must purify in order to fully access

Slides starting from - [[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 1 [2025].pdf#page=12&selection=0,35,0,35|Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 1 [2025], page 12]]
**Karma**; action 
- Good/bad accumulates w/ repeated good/bad actions, habits

Brahman; universal ground of all being – self in its core is brahman, embodied self is what is reborn 

Quote from p.65 (above, "Now, a man...")

**Consciousness–the inner light–is the controller, not the mind**
- Revealed by attempts to control direction of mind; ie. focus on breath 
- Have to catch mind as it wanders to distraction: *microcosm of waking/dreaming cycle* 

	An-atman
	- Not-self, negation of self
	- Buddha targets this later

Brahm*i*ns are seeking to connect w/ atman 

> About this self (atman), one can only say "not , not "
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=135&selection=5,21,6,13|p.50]]

** famous quote
- The self, brahman, is *in*effable, *not* graspable, etc. Because it trancends language, we can only describe it using negative expressions - maximally inclusive way of talking (saying something *is* X is saying it is *not* anything but X)

King gives over everything recognizing Yaj. as true king

There is only **one self** because self is the same as the ground of all being
- There are a plurality of selves but there is only one nature
- Beings that are generated in dreams appear different but are born of same mind; same as with all individual selves 

What accounts for differences in desire
- Where brahman is ocean and individual selves are waves, the differences = depths, external acting factors on waves
- Unmanifest = depths of ocean

Only sentient beings carry brahman in a realizable way 

Moment of death is crucial for bringing positive or negative into next life; amplifies everything

Good things are things that lead to liberation, ie purification from desire

Paradox of trying to trancend desire because you must desire to do it

When we die, *desire* draws us back into embodied state
Ego is ultimate desire, the "I, me, my"

# Lecture 4 01.16.25 
### Chandogya Upanisad (CU), p. 171-175
Prajapati ("Lord of creatures," creator god) teaches the demon Virocana and god Indra about the self (atman)

*Teleological desire*, the ultimate *goal* of no suffering
> Teleology; description of the universe in terms of purpose/goal 

'Maghavan' = epithet, meaning bountiful (familiar) way of referring to **Indra**

**Firewood ritual**
Outer fire (in ritual) has to be internalized; internally generated heat which purifies oneself 
→ 'Outer' rituals of asceticism which are also internal purification

**After first 32 years - the body is the self**
- Praj. says that you see the true self in the mirror, in the eye
- Aka true self is the body, in waking state
> Seeing the two depart, Prajapati observed: 'There they go, without learning about the self (atman) without discovering the self! The side that will hold to this correspondence (upanisad), whether it is the gods or the demons, is bound to be vanquished.'
> p. 172

→ Demons focus on/treat body as self, and (later in Buddhist myth) often mess with people's bodies

Gods tend to be pretty full of themselves, but are still bound to die 
→ But, Indra says, 'then, the self will become blind, crippled, die when the body does. this isn't worthwhile' 

**After second 32 years - the dream self is the self**

But, Indra says, 'dreams can include suffering, nightmares.'

**After third 32 years - the dreamless sleep is the self**

But, Indra says, 
> 'But this self as just explained, you see, does not perceive itself fully as, "I am this"; it does not even know any of these beings here. It has become completely annihilated. I see nothing worthwhile in this.'
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=294&selection=1,30,4,32|p.174]]

Two ways of understanding dreamless sleep: *different from previous description we saw*
- Pure oneness, only remembered if one has reached liberation
- Blackout state, how can it be liberating?

**After final 5 years - 101 total now**

Praj. says:
> One who has a body is in the grip of joy and sorrow, and there is no freedom from joy and sorrow for one who has a body. Joy and sorrow, however, do not affect one who has no body. 
> 
> 'The wind is without a body, and so are the rain-cloud, lightning, and thunder. These are without bodies. Now, as these, after they rise up from the space up above and reach the highest light, emerge in their own true appearance, in the very same way, this deeply serene one, after he rises up from this body and reaches the highest light, emerges in his own true appearance. He is the highest person. He roams about there, laughing, playing, and enjoying himself with women, carriages, or relatives, without remembering the appendage that is this body. The lifebreath is yoked to this body, as a draught animal to a cart. 

Older idea (than other descriptions in previous upanisads), simplistically akin to going to heaven 


> 'Now, when this sight here gazes into space, that is the seeing person, the faculty of sight enables one to see. The one who is aware: "Let me smell this"—that is the self; the faculty of smell enables him to smell. The one who is aware: "Let me say this"— that is the self; the faculty of speech enables him to speak. The one who is aware: "Let me listen to this"—that is the self; the faculty of hearing enables him to hear. 5 The one who is aware: "Let me think about this"—that is the self; the mind is his divine faculty of sight. This very self rejoices as it perceives with his mind, with that divine sight, these objects of desire found in the world of *brahman*. 
> 
> 'It is this self that the gods venerate, as a result of which they have obtained all the worlds and have had all their desires fulfilled. Likewise, when someone discovers this self and comes to perceive it, he will obtain all the worlds and have all his desires fulfilled.' 
> 
> That was what Prajapati said
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=295&selection=8,20,9,16|p.175]]

Similar to king & Yaj. dialogue, 

Dreamless as blackout
Self as liberated from all states when no longer bodily, purified → rises to heavenly space, where it is free to roam and experience only pleasure
- More similar to vedas in description 

**No mention of rebirth/karma**

If you've reached heaven, and you eventually are reborn from being in heaven for a while, you will probably live a good life.. mid life, mid. world, reborn mid

*How does one stop the rebirth cycle?*: /Deeper/ liberation
*What is moving us between realms?*: Motivation and desire

The idea of brahman that is presented here is on the way out (despite being later than the Yaj/king dialogue), coming to be replaced by the idea of karma 
→ can't be about satisfying desire, but trancending desire

This text:
- Purify self through austerity, will naturally rise into higher spirit

Yaj/King text (**BU**):
- More sophisticated version, liberation from act and desire, although this presents further complications/problems
	- Paradox of desiring no desire, have to kind of "stumble upon" it 
- *First introduction of both karma and rebirth*

	In Buddha's perspective, human form gives best shot at liberation–moreso than gods–bc they are too full of themselves
	- Can connect comparing **CU** & **BU**, where conversation between gods is less philosophically sophisticated than between humans
	
	Flux of traditional vedic practices as small agrarian society becomes to restructure as kingdoms: *Crisis of meaning*

***3 views on what happens after you die:***
- **This text, CU**: you die you go to heaven
- **Yaj text, BU.**: you die you get reborn
- Third possibiliy: you die you die (materialism) - this is kind of a tangent from him lol
	- Minority view; Materialism
	- When you die you die; no heaven no hell no rebirth no liberation – seen across ancient world, China, Greece, India (charvaka)
	- Bc, how can you get something of the nature of consciousness, luminosity, out of the physical elements of the earth

# Lecture 5 01.21.25
### Kena Upanisad (KU) pp. 227-228
Kena = "by whom?"

Teachings are heard/revealed/manifest, not authored by individuals

Atman is the one "by whom" there is perception and knowledge, and atman-brahman is the power behind the workings of the universe, internal and external 

**KU Verse 1** 
> By whom does the mind soar forth {go toward its object}? 
> Being directed by whom does the breath {life force} march on as the first {proceed to function}? 
> By whom is speech impelled {so that one speaks}? 
> And who is the god that joins the sight and hearing {what force directs sight and hearing}?

**KU Verse 2** 
> That which is the hearing behind hearing, the thinking behind thinking, the speech behind speech, the sight behind sight, the breathing behind breathing—free from these the wise become immortal when they depart from this world. 

I.e., the wise who separate the ātman from the sensory functions, the mind, and the body become immortal. 

- The wise who identifies the true source behind all senses is liberated 
- Would be a mistake to confuse the mind/body/self as the same things
	- Mind = "cognitive system", self = ground of that, behind it, pure consciousness

Constricting to tie self to mind, memories. Self being the expansiveness of universe = blissful and truly liberating in a sort of literal sense 
Ego maximization   

**KU Verse 3**
> Sight, thinking, and speech do not reach it. 
> So we do not know it or perceive it or know how to point it out. 
> It is different from what is known and beyond what is unknown.

Can not be pointed at as an object because it is not an object (see; can only be described through negation)

**KU Verses 4-8** 
> What speech can’t express, but that by which speech is expressed; what the mind can’t know, but that by which the mind is known; what sight can’t see, but that by which sight is seen; what hearing can’t hear, but that by which hearing is heard; what breathing can’t breathe, but that by which breath is drawn out – *that is alone is Brahman, and not what people venerate here.*

Wrong to focus overly on external rituals like fire, public social rites; must be inward rituals, asceticism
- Anti-establishment message

Atman/Brahman distinction
"quest for self" - "quest for fundamental knowledge of being" (framing, not distinct things)

Upanisads are not contradicting vedas (or the older vedas, since they are also a part of vedas) but saying focus exclusively on outer/external ritual is missing the point
→Other traditions entirely reject the vedas, ie. Buddha
- Buddha's view of Upan.: Codification of practices, but not "expressing knowledge necessary for liberation"
"Hindu" is a British term 


### Katha Upanisad (KTU) pp. 232-246
Origin of expression "razor's edge" (and inspiration for the novel)

Naciketas' father (brahmin) giving away all positions as sacrifice
Boy thinks he will be given away too, asks to whom– Father, in exasperation, says "to death": and has to follow through on his word
God of death Yama 
		Since he can’t take back his words, he tells Naciketas that, when he arrives at Death’s residence, Death will be away and Naciketas will have to stay there three days without food. Since it’s a great discourtesy to let a brahmin guest say in one’s house without food, Yama will have to grant him three wishes. 

First wish: Return to father's house alive 
Second wish: Explain how the fire-altar leads to heaven 
Third wish: Explain the mystery of death

***Answers:*** 
**Yama**
- *Even ancient gods had doubts, it's hard to understand*–make another wish, pick long life, pleasures
Naciketas refuses, says this knowledge is ephemeral 

**Yama**
- You have picked good over gratifying, knowledge over ignorance
- You have to understand "the primeval one" - atman 
	- Hidden in the cave of the heart (energetic seat of atman in the body)
- *Om* 
	- The sacred syllable, which expresses through its sound and structure *Brahman*
- The wise one {atman} is eternal, undying

*Some of the most famous lines of the upan. pp. 239-240* 
> If the killer thinks that he kills; 
> If the killed thinks that he is killed; 
> Both of them fail to understand, 
> He neither kills, nor is he killed. 
> Finer than the finest, larger than the largest is the self (ātman) that lies here hidden in the heart of a living being. 
> Without desires and free from sorrow, 
> a man perceives by the creator’s grace 
> the grandeur of the self.
> Sitting down, he roams afar. 
> Lying down, he goes everywhere. 
> The gods ceaselessly exulting— 
> Who, besides me, is able to know? 
> When he perceives this immense, all-pervading self, 
> as bodiless within bodies, 
> as stable within unstable beings— 
> A wise man ceases to grieve.

Inspires **Ralph Waldo Emerson**, trancendentalist - writes poem *Brahma* (meaning Brahman, misspelling because Brahma is a god and different thing)
> If the red slayer thinks he slays, 
> Or if the slain thinks he is slain, 
> They know not well the subtle ways 
> I keep, and pass, and turn again

Slain is not slain, killed is not killed - famous also because spoken by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita

**Imagery of the chariot: The structure of the knowing, embodied self**
*pp. 238-239*
> Know the self as a rider in a chariot, 
> and the body, as simply the chariot. 
> Know the intellect as the charioteer, 
> and the mind, as simply the reins. 
> 
> The senses, they say, are the horses, 
> and sense objects are the paths around them; 
> he who is linked to the body, senses, and mind, 
> the wise proclaim as the one who enjoys

- The embodied self (in life) is the rider
- the body is the chariot
- the intellect (discriminative knowledge/faculty of discrimination: telling between one thing and the next) is the charioteer
- the mind (that which integrates sensory information) is the reins
- and the senses are the horses (pulling us in different directions)
- the paths are the objects (the things the senses perceive)
- The one who has the body, senses, and mind is the one who enjoys–meaning, the one who *experiences* 

The charioteer is not the supreme controller because the *ultimate direction* comes from the rider 
Self is mostly a passive witness

*Samsara* = the round of rebirth, cycle of existence 

*The razor’s edge (p. 240)* 
> Arise! Awake! Pay attention, 
> when you’ve obtained your wishes! 
> A razor’s edge is hard to cross— 
> that, poets say, is the difficulty of the path. 
> It has no sound or touch, 
> no appearance, taste or smell; 
> It is without beginning or end, 
> undecaying and eternal; 
> When a man perceives it, 
> fixed and beyond the immense, 
> He is free from the jaws of death.

Negatives, without things 
Being reborn is not about living again but about dying again; dying another death

How do we perceive it? By reversing the outward projection and turning inward - 
*(p. 240)*
> “The Self-existent One pierced the apertures outward, therefore one looks out, and not into oneself. A certain wise man in search of immortality turned his sight inward and saw the self within” 

Apertures = senses
Yoga is the stilling of the turning of the mind: then, the pure seer/witness can abide in its own true form 
Stopping the horses running, then quieting the mind–first, calming it as it panics at the lack of senses, then the intellect stilled and quieted → *then, the one who is behind, the atman shines forth*
- Patanjali's Yoga sutras
- If you can abide by the dissolution and stilling then you can achieve liberation

### Mandukya Upanisad (MaU)
**End of the Upanisads**
#### Four "feet"/quarters of the self 
- 3 states of the self that we know: dreaming, dreamless, waking
- 3 phonemes of the sacred syllable OM (AUM in sanskrit)

**First Quarter: Vaisvanara** / A /
- *The universal one*
- Situated in the waking state
- Perceiving the outside 
- Enjoying "gross" (as in obvious) things 
- Coarsest, least subtle state
/ A /
- Lips open, coarsest sound


**Second Quarter: Taijasa** / U /
- *The brilliant one*
- Situated in the dream state
- Perceiving the inside 
- Enjoying refined things
/ U / 
- Subtler, sound – mouth narrows, more specific

**Third Quarter: Prajña** / M /
- Single mass of percep/consc./awareness
- Bliss
- Thought as mouth
- Lord of all, origin, dissolution of beings
- Closest to brahman
- Sankar believes it is possible to be lucid in deep sleep, interpenetration
- Departure of subject/object structure; ego dissolution, taste of oneness
	- Awareness of nothing but the self, but not as an object – *reflexivity*
/ M / 
- Lips come together, vibratory state
- Feels good 

**Fourth Quarter**  {AUM} / __ /
- Atman
- Indescribable, etc. 
- Perception of self alone

> Without a second

- Non-numerable one
- That which should be perceived/known/realized
- Debated if the fourth quarter is the whole syllable or silence
- Silence: Unmanifest, but the source from which all arises

*AUM is the self*

**Yoga**
- Disciplining and stilling the mind/body system so that *awareness* can manifest without obstruction 
- Practicing yoga → lucidity through *all three* states
	- Pure consciousness is the constant thread which runs through all states
	- If you can inhabit the perspective of pure awareness you can fully liberate mind and always be fully present

What is it that creates some continuity or connection between atman and the mind which is an object/subject in the physical world? 
Bc if karmic judgement (or goodness/badness of action) is to exist and memories of past lives can be accessed in some states then there is some kind of tie even if atman is untouched by good or bad 



# Lecture 7 01.28.25 - Buddhism

[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 2 [2025].pdf]]
### Buddha (485-405 BCE)
"*The maximally awakened/enlightened one*"
Sanscrit/pali

Siddhartha: "one whos aim is accomplished"

There come to be more buddhas, so this buddha is identified specifically by Sakyamuni meaning of the Sakya clan

Artistic representations of Buddha influenced by Greek art (although this style came hundreds of years later)

Only accounts of buddha are from centuries later, orally transmitted

Oral preservation, based on metric structure + repetition, very robust–more so than writing 

Many verses begin with:
> "Thus have I heard..."
> "So I heard..."

Certifies as legit teaching bc/ remembered by Ananda

Disciples would gather for repetitions 

Buddha's teachings: 
- *Remembered*  = Sutras
- *Scholarly systematization* = Dharma

We don't have real concrete historical evidence of Buddha existing, akin to Homer 
→ We don't know which language he spoke, although it wouldn't have been Pali (which much is written in)

Corpus in Sanskrit has been lost, only preserved in the later Chinese translations of them 

##### Timeline
**Vedic period**: 1500-500 BCE
- Earliest Upanisad: 700 BCE
**Epic/Classical period**: 500 BCE - 500 CE
- Buddha emerges early in this period
**Medieval period**: 500-1500 CE
- Shankara: 700 CE
- Indian logic, theory of inference, epistemology emerging
- Islam enters India in this period

*China*: Warring states period
- Confucius/Konzi is travelling, advising states: 551-479
- Mengzi follower who continues and elaborates on Confucius: 372-289


Aśoka (emperor largely responsible for the spread of Buddhism in India.): 269-231 BCE

##### Biography
*compiled from later narratives about his life*
**Siddharta Gautama**
- Born in Sakya clan: Kapilavastu, W. Nepal near India
- Grows up comfortably, but leaves to become a sramana (recluse)
	- Later stories about him being a prince, although more likely he was not

Travels from one yoga master to another, attaining their highest level/most liberating yogic states, but he is unsatsifed as each one is temporary 

Takes up with ascetics who are extremely restrictive in eating, sleeping, to attain altered states–Buddha does this, but realizes it is killing him, so leaves

Through his own insights, attains awakening–*bodhi*–the realization of *Nirvana*

Doesn't want to teach bc/ he thinks ppl won't understand

Brama manifests in front of Buddha and begs him to teach what he has discovered 
- Implication about how Gods are as unable to attain liberation/understand how as people
- Positioning Buddha as superior to Vedic culture 

Story abt what he does: 
- First goes to his yogis; they have died
- Comes across recluse (name: Upaka), who believes in a spirituality of fate/determinism (not Vedic)
	- Recluse sees his state of calm says who taught you this?? Buddha says no one, I'll teach you – recluse says nah I'm good
- Buddhist texts positioning Buddha not only against Vedic but against other non-Vedic faiths

Decides to go teach for rest of his 45 years

Former ascetic friends receive Buddha's first teaching

**Historical context**
Brahmanism:
- Vedic ritual and sacrificial culture. 
- Upanishadic vision of ātman-brahman. 
Śramaṇas: 
- Deniers of karma and mokṣa (liberation) - (Ājīvīkas, materialists). 
- Jain asceticism

The Buddha rejects Brahmanism and the various Śramaṇic doctrines as misguided and not conducive to liberation. 

Instead, he propounds an original view based on the following radical ideas.

##### Fundamental ideas
Everything we experience is process—constant change with no unchanging essence.
- Everything is in flux

Process or change is not random; it is patterned according to various cause-effect *regularities*.

**Karma** is the *ethical* factor at work in these causal *regularities*, and it is fundamentally a mental factor—how volitions (intentions), wholesome and unwholesome, condition or affect the constantly changing processes of the world that we experience, aka, everything 
- {ethicization of karma}. 
- Action which arises out of desire/motivation, which begins in the mind 'stream'
- *Karma is intention*
- Good/bad effects contingent upon mental action/intention

Liberation from suffering is attainable through a combination of wisdom (right understanding), ethics (moral discipline), and meditation. 

*Evan's Cigarette Tale*
- Intention leads to action leads to habit
	- Like walking the same way on grass repeatedly, which over time changes the world as it becomes a path

Causality within mind stream as bad intentions lead to more bad intentions 
→ *The more you do something the more you're likely to do it, both internal and external* 

Buddha does not think there is an inner soul or spirit which is the author of the intention
Self is just a stream of mental events
#### Buddha's First Teaching

**The Middle Way** 
- The Dhamma (dharma in sanskrit) is a middle path between self-indulgence (society) and self-mortification (asceticism): Balance

**The Noble Eightfold Path** 
- The Dhamma as a path comprising right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness {sati in Pali: memory – mindfulness means *holding something in mind and not forgetting: keeping track of the mind*}, and right concentration {*remaining present and focused*}. 
- No 1:1 translation with english "meditation" – closest means "cultivation", as in, cultivating mindfulness and concentration

**The Four Noble Truths** (*aka, the right view in the Noble Eightfold*)
- Suffering, its origination, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation (the eightfold path leading to Nibbāna/Nirvāna). 

1. There is suffering (*dukha/duhkha*).
2. There is the origination of suffering {suffering comes into existence in dependence on causes}.
	1. Therefore, it is impermanent: it both arises and can cease → 
3. There is the cessation of suffering {all future suffering can be prevented}.
4. There is a path to the cessation of suffering {the Noble Eightfold Path}.

Medical format
Diagnosis: there is suffering, and it has a cause
Prognosis: it can cease
Prescription: this is how you stop it 

*List formats arise from systematization*

#### Four Noble Truths
##### There is suffering (dukha/duhkha)
- Not (just) ordinary pain, but existential suffering. 
- Traditionally described as *three-layered*, each more subtle than its predecessor.

1. Suffering as painful experiences. (most superficial)
	1. Immediate unpleasant sensation of hurting + mental reaction to it (worry, anguish, dread, frustration, etc.). 
2. Suffering as impermanence. 
	1. Nothing lasts, everything changes and is eventually lost, hence we’re always in pursuit of something new, anxiously knowing we’ll lose it too.
3. Suffering as due to conditions. (deepest)
	1.  Not getting what one wants; getting what one doesn’t want; getting what one wants and inevitably losing it. 
	2. Suffering due to the conditions that result in rebirth-redeath: craving, {literally:} thirst, desire, attachment.
		1. Everything is made of constituent parts which interact in undesirable ways (such as body)
		2. *Cyclicality*: every part of wheel is dependent on what came prior 

*Treadmill perspective:*
Whatever happiness one gains is outweighed by the inevitable loss, so that one has the sense of going nowhere, a sense that leads to alienation and despair
- Micro: From moment to moment, in the stream of the mind
- Macro: From life to life

#### Four Noble Truths cont.
##### The origin of suffering
Ignorance (warped way of knowing things/misunderstanding) where we ascrube permanent unchanging self to ourselves & essence to things→ Phenomenal self 
*Root of suffering = delusion of self* 
- Belief in perm. → craving for perm. = Constantly being thwarted by impermanence of life = root of suffering

##### Cessation of suffering
Because there is a cause, we can remove the cause and achieve liberation, "cure" suffering

> And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, nonattachment.

##### How does one cease suffering
Not just treat the symptoms but the underlying ccause, the attachment & cognitive delusion
*→ Noble eightfold path*

#### Noble Eightfold Path

1. Right view. 
2. Right intention. 
	1. *1, 2: Wisdom*
3. Right speech. 
4. Right action. 
5. Right livelihood. 
	1. *3, 4, 5: Moral Discipline*
6. Right effort. 
7. Right mindfulness. 
8. Right concentration.
	1. *6, 7, 8: Meditation*
All of these are interconnected w/ each other

Intention is that which moves the mind which motivates action

Livelihood should not derive from harmful profession (weapons trade, prostitution, butchery–although many buddhists not-vegetarian–)/*minimize harm to others*

Somewhat abstract, culturally dependent how to interpret these as a Buddhist

Meditation = training the mind, cultivating certain mental qualities/traits

Effort = actually trying to do all this, reminding self of purpose → view, intention, etc. 

Mindfulness = memory, keeping something in mind 
- First: mindfulness of the inbreath/outbreath
	- Trying this at first mind wanders from the *intented effort of mindfulness (3x!)* - but, then we notice we have wandered from our intention
		- *In cogsci terms* - Intended effort of attention is dynamic (breath is changing), the more attention the more we can notice the variation and its relation to our thoughts and feelings
		- Mindfulness includes process of "noticing" what you are attending to 
		- *In cogsci terms* - Meta awareness
		- Distractions are often salient; potent, grip which is difficult to escape even when you do have the intention
			- We have to notice and return without punishing self/disappointment which only perpetuates suffering → continue this wander/return cycle repetitively
- → Craving/mental thirst 

Concentration is implicit in mindfulness; sustained attention 

Once you have attained mindfulness of breathing → mindfulness of feeling → mindfulness of mental factors 

Meditation can only be practiced with moral discipline bc/ mindfulness must have solid virtuous intention, livelihood

*Path to freedom from suffering* 

Buddha says he has discovered these himself, not contained in vedas or upanisads, although upanisads has pieces of it
- Upanisads present freedom/liberation as atman/brahman unity, Buddha just as cessation of craving, although both stop the cycle of samsara/rebirth

### First of Buddha's teachings
[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 3 [2025].pdf]]

##### [[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=25&selection=4,0,7,18|THE WORLD IS EMPTY]]

Ananda = Buddha's disciple who follows him everywhere and remembers all his teaching 

*Emptiness = lack of a self*
- Emptiness returns often and with great significance

Everything (all that there is in the purview of experience)–vision, consciousness, bodily/experience–is empty of self → *the world is empty*

Monks & nuns go into village to beg for food, villagers support because it's considered good karma/auspicious to support a recluse, then return to monastery

>  “Monks, what do you think: do you consider **bodily experience** in this way: ‘This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self’?”
> "No sir"

We already know from upanisads that body ≠ self

> “Very good, monks! Bodily experience should not be considered in this way: ‘This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self,’ and instead it should be seen with correct understanding as it really is. What about perception, feelings, habitual traits, and con- sciousness? Do you regard them in this way: ‘This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self’?”
> “No, sir.”
> "Very good, monks!"


Aggregate = "heap" like pile of sand (in sanskrit)

#### The Five Aggregates
*Map of psycho-physical system, comprising these fluxuating parts, all of which are **empty of self***
1. **Forms**: Anything corporeal or physical - bodily experience, esp. from perspective of how it is experienced
2. **Feelings**: Sensations (all senses) - in Buddh., all feelings are *valenced* ('hedonic valence') - pleasure pain indiff.
3. **Perceptions**: Mental events which allow us to grasp/recognize something as basis for naming it
4. **Habitual traits**: Dispositions/intentions - cognitive and affective ways of being disposed to act in a certain way - inc. things like anger, compassion
5. **Consciousness**(es, plural): The fact of being aware - inc. visual, olfactory, auditory etc. all senses - & mental consciousness 

- In upanisads, there is a pure self-luminant consciousness
- Buddha's consciousness is based on certain mode of *being* consciousness 
	- ie. Mental consciousness/awareness of mental objects

##### [[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=31&selection=31,0,31,14|A LUMP OF FOAM]]
1. *Lump of foam* is "empty, hollow, and without essential substance" as is **bodily experience**
2. *Water bubble* is **feelings**
3. *Shimmering mirage* is **perception**
	1. you have attributed it perm and stability which it does not have; illusory 
4. *Plantain trunk* (without heartwood) is **habitual traits**
	1. Dispositions/mental qualities we have which condition psycho-phys system to be a certain way 
5. *Magician's illusion* is **consciousness** 
	1. Magicians would use "power of the mantra" to make a snake "appear" - apparition, illusion, fabrication - illusion = 'something that presents itself as being in a way that it isn't' (in Buddhism)

All without "essential substance", without self
- Essential substance being the thing that gives something constancy/permanence (atman, from upanisad perspective)

#### Self
Essence of the person or individual sentient being
Essence =  the one part whose continued existence is required for the person or individual sentient being to continue to exist (to be one and the same person/being over time).

e.g., my fifth birthday was experienced by the same me as I am now

**[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 3 [2025].pdf#page=5&selection=0,0,0,26|What do we mean by self?]]**

> To say that there is a self (in this precise sense) is to say that there is some one part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time. 
> 
> The person continues to exist as long as that self continues to exist.

>  The same person if and only if the same self. 
>  
>  “Same” here means numerically the same—one and the same thing.

In the day to day sense; "I" = person/individual being

But if ther eis a self- essential - then that is what "I" refers to, the part that is necessary for the continued existence of one and the same person 
- This part is "me", whereas other parts would be "mine" 
- What is "mine" may qualitatively change, but the "me" stays numerically the same
- "I" am the owner of these experiences; they are had by the numerically identical "me"
- So self as the essence of the person is also the owner of its changing mental and bodily states

#### No-self (anatman/anatta) 
Anatta = Pali

Buddha denies that there is a self, that is, that ther eis an essence of the person
The individual person/sentient pbeing is said to lack and essence
We use "I" in everyday speech to pick out an individual being– the one speaking– but there is no essence "I" or "me" and hence no real owner of what we call "mine"

# Lecture 9 Cancelled

# Lecture 10 02.06.25

#### No-self cont. 
*Five aggregates* leave nothing out: exhaustive of everything that makes up a person
- Constantly changing → no unchanging essence among five aggr.
- Contrast Upan.; atman/brahman 
- Self would have to be either essential or supreme controller, neither of which in five aggr.

##### Argument from impermanence


"The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving"
https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.038.than.html
- Buddha and Sati, the fisherman's son
- Sati says: Subject to karma
>  consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises

Consciousness is "of something" - not intangible

>  “And what is consciousness? … There are these six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose- consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. This is called consciousness.”

Series of momentary conscious events/mental events makes up a life  

#### Rebirth

> [!callout]  How can there be rebirth without there being something that is reborn? 
>
> A series of mental events carries on from this life to another one, with the last mental event at death *conditioning* (as consciousness dependent on condition) the next brith 

This is caused by ***dependent arising***
- **Karma** is a mental phenomenon which is included under the fourth aggregate (*habitual traits*)

##### Dependent arising
>  **Dependent arising**: a sequence, consisting of 12 links (factors) in a chain, over the course of three successive lives.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 10.26.05 AM.png|500]]

Appropriating these moments of life; the feeling of ownership over one's changing, non-self

##### *In summary (!!!QUIZ!!!!)*
**Basic logic:** 
- One is born into this life because in the last life one acted on the basis of volitions that were formed in ignorance. 
	- *Formed in ignorance (under the illusion of there being a permanent self)*
- Being born with a body means that one comes into contact with sense objects. 
	- *Whatever form you have has a sensory experience *
- This brings about feelings of pleasure, pain and indifference. 
	- *Senses → Feelings (pleasure, pain, indifference)*
- These feelings trigger desires. 
	- *Feelings → desire: our feelings cause us to be motivated in certain ways, desiring certain things*
- Desires conditioned by ignorance lead to appropriation: taking certain things as “me” or “mine.” 
	- *Desires → appropriation: "I" am oriented towards or away from things*
- And this fuels rebirth and produces suffering.
	- *Appropriation → rebirth, suffering*

This sequence occurs *w/o* core existing self: none of the elements are "self", so they don't sum to "self" either

Explains how the illusory sense of self arises thorugh the *causal workings* of *impersonally linked* mental and physical factors
	*→ Reductionism is an old, not modern, way of thinking*

# 02.11.25 Lecture 11 - *Skipped*

**2 arguments for no-self: impermanence and *control***

#### Argument from (lack of) control
- References Upanisads, which refer to atman as supreme controller
- Aggregates are not subject to control → no self

#### The argument form complex wholes (chariot argument)
[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 4 [2025].pdf#page=8&selection=0,0,2,17|Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 4 [2025], page 8]] 

#### 2 truths: "Ways of Talking About This"
##### Conventional
IFF it is acceptable to common sense and consistently leads to successful practice
##### Ultimate
IFF it corresponds to the facts and neither asserts nor presupposes the existence of any conventional realities

*Ultimately* there is no Nagasena but *conventionally* there is Nagasena; same with chariot: 

##### The chariot (complex whole) principle
> Whatever has constituents depends upon these constituents for its existence, and depends upon our conceiving this "many" as a "one" for its unity, and so does not exist ultimately, but only (at best) conventionally

What is conventionally real is at best constructed (constructivists) → samsara is a conceptual construction

Any concept is both positive and negative
- Like a grid which chunks certain things into a slot and excludes certain things from that slot
- What we do or don't consider as inclusion/exclusion criteria is conventional, not ultimate

***→ Application to the self*** 
- The self depends on the five aggregates
- It depends on conceiving these aggregates as a unity
- It therefore does not exist ultimately, only conventionally
- "Self" is a conventional designation

***→ Nothing complex can be ultimately real, because it depends on its constituents: it exists only conventionally***

Grass fire sweeping across a hill:
- Appears to be moving from one place to the next, but is instead a series of *causally linked* instantaneous moments 
#### Candrakirti's sevenfold reasoning
*Introduction to the Middle Way*
5 centuries after the King and Nagasena
In the line of Nagarjuna 

##### Ascertaining the object to be negated
An inherently existent self, either corresponding to the innate feeling of self, or an artificial conception based on an intellectually acquired theory about the nature of phenomena
- Conception of self that we acquire, relating to theory about nature of phenomena
- Distinct but interrelated
- Such a self would exist objectively, ind. of thought  
- Object of negation is *not* the conventionally existent person

***Seven → Two*** 
Either 1) the self is identical to the aggregates, or 2) the self is different from the aggregates
→ Either the self is the same as its bases of imputation, or it is different 

Neither makes sense, so the self does not exist inherently but is only *mentally imputed* %%imputed: ascribed%%

The analysis (sevenfold reasoning) = "analytical meditation" applied to the object of negation, so as to uproot the innate feeling of self

**Inferential cognition**
- (Example from Indian philosophy) From the valley, you look to the mountains and see smoke: the inference is that there is fire in the mountains because there is smoke: you perceive one thing, you know that wherever there is smoke there is fire (regularity), so you infer there is fire without seeing it 
- When you practice this meditation, you generate inferential cognition where you perceive the five aggregates, then you infer the absence of self 
- Direct realization: you *realize, experience* the truth of no self without inference

**Madhyamaka** (Middle Way): According to Candrakirti's *Middle Way*, the same reasoning applies universally: 
***All phenomena are empty of inherent existence and exist only conventionally***

__ thinkers say there is no difference between conventional and ultimate

Nagarjuna says there is *no difference* between samsara and **nirvana**
