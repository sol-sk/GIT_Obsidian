> Upaniṣads, 28-30, 34-52, 58-71, 171-175.

Interpretations of "Upanisad"
- To sit close beside: secret oral teaching from teacher to disciple
- Connection, equivalence: contains secret knowledge of hidden connections among things → *Atman (true self) + brahman (ultimate source)* = ultimate secret connection
	- Vedanta school believes atman = brahman - nonduality
	- Knowing highest brahamn => becoming highest brahman
	- True knowledge as state of oneness/unity, blending subj & obj.

**In earlier Vedic hymns:**
Brahman = *power contianed in recited words/hymns*
- Est. connection between utterer and cosmos through sound
Atman is vital breath/life essence of human

**In Upanisads:**
Brahman synonymous w/ being while also capturing this power
Atman = self, ultimate essence

### Brhadaranyaka Upanisad (BU)
Dialogue between brahmin sage Yajnavalka (Yaj) and King Janaka of Videha

King asks: **What is the source of light?**
- Sun → moon → fire → voice → *atman*, self
- External → internal outer → inner

Atman exists in both worlds, one waking and one sleeping 
- Dream world is intermediate between waking and death (third world)

#  01.09.25 Lecture 2 
~700 BCE, before Greeks
"first text of world philosophy"
### Brhadaranyaka (BU) 4.3-4.4 (pp.58-68), partial recap of Lecture 1
##### Yajnavalkya (abbr. Yaj.)
- Great teacher, sarcastic, irreverent 
- Poking fun at other priests who he interprets as not knowing the meaning of the text
- Defeats 8 brahmins in debate, including the woman Gargi, who is strongest–tells others not to bother once she's been defeated
	- Women in Upan.; patriarchal society, but there are components of it (Gargi, Maitreyi-1st wife of Yaj.), who are portrayed as interested in philosophy, intelligent
- Wives: Maitreyi, Katyayani 
- Eventually leaves society, ascetic way of life 
Tradnl ways of life being undermined, questioning of tradnl. rituals → asceticism, rigorous rituals of mind and body, to find liberation ("original hippies")→ Buddha arises from this 

"Sun rises and sets, the self is always there"
- From outwards to inwards
- The true self shines constant (Fire, light metaphors throughout) - luminosity of true consciousness

**Dreams**
- Dreaming = traveling, change to mode of awareness 
	- In the dream state, the self is a creator; dream state is handling the materials of the mind, inc. materials from previous lives
		- *All experiences leave an impression* - this is why, in asceticism, it is crucial to pay attention to what your mind is drawn to and to cultivate good thoughts
	- Self ≠ mind 
- Dream state is handling waking experiences at a more fine-grained level, refined, subtler 
- The intensity of light, "hyperreal" quality of dreams, brightness of dreams: it is our light of **consciousness, the inner light**; a necessary/preconditn to *all* experience, incl. consc. 

**King Janaka**
Offering 1000 cows
Pressing Yaj. 

- Stream/flow between waking and sleeping - "fish going back and forth," eagle perching
- Affinity btw. dreaming and memory 
	- See later: "stream of consc." from psych/phil William James, 19th c. & Freud, modernist literature
		- Upan. is first place this idea is seen in world literature
- Made explicit by **Shankara** in *780 CE*–1000 years later–that there is not a distinction between waking/dreaming states; interpenetration, fractal. 
	- Lucid dreaming, daydreaming, any kind of thought that isn't regarding the here and now is the mind considering its own material 

**Waking, dreaming, and third state:** *Dreamless sleep, deep sleep* 
- When the eagle stops flying and perches: *dreamless sleep is alert and watchful* → this becomes a debate throughout Indian philosophy, if dreamless sleep is a blackout state or if there is consciousness present
	- Do you make an inference that you were asleep based on how you feel when you wake, or is it necessary that your consciousness is online in order to make that inference 
		- Cognitive processing offline but consciousness present, no explicit memory but you can retain lingering feeling %% is there a distinct kind/state/form of memory for emotion in this way? %%
- Dreamless state: no subj/obj. structure, even more *inward*–to core of self–than dreaming state 

> Here a father is not a father, a mother is not a mother, worlds are not worlds, gods are not gods, and Vedas are not Vedas. Here a thief is not a thief, an abortionist is not an abortionist, an outcaste is not an outcaste, a pariah is not a pariah, a recluse is not a recluse, and an ascetic is not an ascetic. Neither the good nor the bad follow him, for he has now passed beyond all sorrows of the heart. p. 60-61

**Death**
> “Now, as this self  (atman)  grows steadily weaker and begins to lose consciousness, these vital functions  (prana)  throng around him. **Taking into himself these particles of light, he descends back into the heart**. When the person connected with sight turns back, the man loses his ability to perceive visible forms.  2   So people say: "He's sinking; he can't see!"—"He's sinking; he can't smell!"—"He's sinking; he can't taste!"—"He's sinking; he can't speak!"—"He's sinking; he can't hear!"—"He's sinking; he can't think!"—"He's sinking; he can't feel a touch!"— "He's sinking; he can't perceive!" Then the top of his heart lights up, **and with that light the self exits through the eye or the head or some other part of the body**. As he is departing, his lifebreath  (prana)  departs with him. **And as his lifebreath departs, all his vital functions  (prana)  depart with it.**”
> 
> “It is like this. As a caterpillar, when it comes to the tip of a blade of grass, reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it, so the self  (atman),  after it has knocked down this body and rendered it unconscious, **reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it**.”
> pp. 63-64

Brahman; state of being, of same nature as consciousness

*Rebirth*
- Consciousness is not extinguished

> “What a man turns out to be depends on how he acts and on how he conducts himself.”

**Act/action = karma (lit. translation)**
- The reward/punishment is the *result* of karma

> “A man resolves in accordance with his desire, acts in accordance with his resolve, and turns out to be in accordance with his action."

Acts come from *desire*
What you are is what you do, including your *mental actions*; mind acts before body

→ Buddha rejects caste structure

What drives the cycle of life/death/rebirth? *Desire*
→ Buddha works with but rearticulates this

> “Now, a man who does not desire—who is without desires, who is freed from desires, whose desires are fulfilled, whose only desire is his self—his vital functions  (prdna)  do not depart. Brahman  he is, and to  brahman  he goes.”
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=154&selection=19,1,22,22|p.65]] 

*Liberation requires purification from desire:* We get a taste of it, of ego dissolution, in sleep 

*Problem*: existence in rebirth cosmology 
 / *Solution*: liberation, which we have some access to but must purify in order to fully access

**Karma**; action 
- Good/bad accumulates w/ repeated good/bad actions, habits

Brahman; universal ground of all being – self in its core is brahman, embodied self is what is reborn 

Quote from p.65 (above, "Now, a man...")

**Consciousness–the inner light–is the controller, not the mind**
- Revealed by attempts to control direction of mind; ie. focus on breath 
- Have to catch mind as it wanders to distraction: *microcosm of waking/dreaming cycle* 

	An-atman
	- Not-self, negation of self
	- Buddha targets this later

Brahm*i*ns are seeking to connect w/ atman 

> About this self (atman), one can only say "not , not "
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=135&selection=5,21,6,13|p.50]]

** famous quote
- The self, brahman, is *in*effable, *not* graspable, etc. Because it trancends language, we can only describe it using negative expressions - maximally inclusive way of talking (saying something *is* X is saying it is *not* anything but X)

King gives over everything recognizing Yaj. as true king

There is only **one self** because self is the same as the ground of all being
- There are a plurality of selves but there is only one nature
- Beings that are generated in dreams appear different but are born of same mind; same as with all individual selves 

What accounts for differences in desire
- Where brahman is ocean and individual selves are waves, the differences = depths, external acting factors on waves
- Unmanifest = depths of ocean

Only sentient beings carry brahman in a realizable way 

Moment of death is crucial for bringing positive or negative into next life; amplifies everything

Good things are things that lead to liberation, ie purification from desire

Paradox of trying to trancend desire because you must desire to do it

When we die, *desire* draws us back into embodied state
Ego is ultimate desire, the "I, me, my"

# 01.16.25 Lecture 4 
### Chandogya Upanisad (CU), p. 171-175
Prajapati ("Lord of creatures," creator god) teaches the demon Virocana and god Indra about the self (atman)

*Teleological desire*, the ultimate *goal* of no suffering
> Teleology; description of the universe in terms of purpose/goal 

'Maghavan' = epithet, meaning bountiful (familiar) way of referring to **Indra**

**Firewood ritual**
Outer fire (in ritual) has to be internalized; internally generated heat which purifies oneself 
→ 'Outer' rituals of asceticism which are also internal purification

**After first 32 years - the body is the self**
- Praj. says that you see the true self in the mirror, in the eye
- Aka true self is the body, in waking state
> Seeing the two depart, Prajapati observed: 'There they go, without learning about the self (atman) without discovering the self! The side that will hold to this correspondence (upanisad), whether it is the gods or the demons, is bound to be vanquished.'
> p. 172

→ Demons focus on/treat body as self, and (later in Buddhist myth) often mess with people's bodies

Gods tend to be pretty full of themselves, but are still bound to die 
→ But, Indra says, 'then, the self will become blind, crippled, die when the body does. this isn't worthwhile' 

**After second 32 years - the dream self is the self**

But, Indra says, 'dreams can include suffering, nightmares.'

**After third 32 years - the dreamless sleep is the self**

But, Indra says, 
> 'But this self as just explained, you see, does not perceive itself fully as, "I am this"; it does not even know any of these beings here. It has become completely annihilated. I see nothing worthwhile in this.'
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=294&selection=1,30,4,32|p.174]]

Two ways of understanding dreamless sleep: *different from previous description we saw*
- Pure oneness, only remembered if one has reached liberation
- Blackout state, how can it be liberating?

**After final 5 years - 101 total now**

Praj. says:
> One who has a body is in the grip of joy and sorrow, and there is no freedom from joy and sorrow for one who has a body. Joy and sorrow, however, do not affect one who has no body. 
> 
> 'The wind is without a body, and so are the rain-cloud, lightning, and thunder. These are without bodies. Now, as these, after they rise up from the space up above and reach the highest light, emerge in their own true appearance, in the very same way, this deeply serene one, after he rises up from this body and reaches the highest light, emerges in his own true appearance. He is the highest person. He roams about there, laughing, playing, and enjoying himself with women, carriages, or relatives, without remembering the appendage that is this body. The lifebreath is yoked to this body, as a draught animal to a cart. 

Older idea (than other descriptions in previous upanisads), simplistically akin to going to heaven 


> 'Now, when this sight here gazes into space, that is the seeing person, the faculty of sight enables one to see. The one who is aware: "Let me smell this"—that is the self; the faculty of smell enables him to smell. The one who is aware: "Let me say this"— that is the self; the faculty of speech enables him to speak. The one who is aware: "Let me listen to this"—that is the self; the faculty of hearing enables him to hear. 5 The one who is aware: "Let me think about this"—that is the self; the mind is his divine faculty of sight. This very self rejoices as it perceives with his mind, with that divine sight, these objects of desire found in the world of *brahman*. 
> 
> 'It is this self that the gods venerate, as a result of which they have obtained all the worlds and have had all their desires fulfilled. Likewise, when someone discovers this self and comes to perceive it, he will obtain all the worlds and have all his desires fulfilled.' 
> 
> That was what Prajapati said
> [[Upanisads_Olivelle.pdf#page=295&selection=8,20,9,16|p.175]]

Similar to king & Yaj. dialogue, 

Dreamless as blackout
Self as liberated from all states when no longer bodily, purified → rises to heavenly space, where it is free to roam and experience only pleasure
- More similar to vedas in description 

**No mention of rebirth/karma**

If you've reached heaven, and you eventually are reborn from being in heaven for a while, you will probably live a good life.. mid life, mid. world, reborn mid

*How does one stop the rebirth cycle?*: /Deeper/ liberation
*What is moving us between realms?*: Motivation and desire

The idea of brahman that is presented here is on the way out (despite being later than the Yaj/king dialogue), coming to be replaced by the idea of karma 
→ can't be about satisfying desire, but trancending desire

This text:
- Purify self through austerity, will naturally rise into higher spirit

Yaj/King text (**BU**):
- More sophisticated version, liberation from act and desire, although this presents further complications/problems
	- Paradox of desiring no desire, have to kind of "stumble upon" it 
- *First introduction of both karma and rebirth*

	In Buddha's perspective, human form gives best shot at liberation–moreso than gods–bc they are too full of themselves
	- Can connect comparing **CU** & **BU**, where conversation between gods is less philosophically sophisticated than between humans
	
	Flux of traditional vedic practices as small agrarian society becomes to restructure as kingdoms: *Crisis of meaning*

***3 views on what happens after you die:***
- **This text, CU**: you die you go to heaven
- **Yaj text, BU.**: you die you get reborn
- Third possibiliy: you die you die (materialism) - this is kind of a tangent from him lol
	- Minority view; Materialism
	- When you die you die; no heaven no hell no rebirth no liberation – seen across ancient world, China, Greece, India (charvaka)
	- Bc, how can you get something of the nature of consciousness, luminosity, out of the physical elements of the earth

# 01.21.25 Lecture 5
### Kena Upanisad (KU) pp. 227-228
Kena = "by whom?"

Teachings are heard/revealed/manifest, not authored by individuals

Atman is the one "by whom" there is perception and knowledge, and atman-brahman is the power behind the workings of the universe, internal and external 

**KU Verse 1** 
> By whom does the mind soar forth {go toward its object}? 
> Being directed by whom does the breath {life force} march on as the first {proceed to function}? 
> By whom is speech impelled {so that one speaks}? 
> And who is the god that joins the sight and hearing {what force directs sight and hearing}?

**KU Verse 2** 
> That which is the hearing behind hearing, the thinking behind thinking, the speech behind speech, the sight behind sight, the breathing behind breathing—free from these the wise become immortal when they depart from this world. 

I.e., the wise who separate the ātman from the sensory functions, the mind, and the body become immortal. 

- The wise who identifies the true source behind all senses is liberated 
- Would be a mistake to confuse the mind/body/self as the same things
	- Mind = "cognitive system", self = ground of that, behind it, pure consciousness

Constricting to tie self to mind, memories. Self being the expansiveness of universe = blissful and truly liberating in a sort of literal sense 
Ego maximization   

**KU Verse 3**
> Sight, thinking, and speech do not reach it. 
> So we do not know it or perceive it or know how to point it out. 
> It is different from what is known and beyond what is unknown.

Can not be pointed at as an object because it is not an object (see; can only be described through negation)

**KU Verses 4-8** 
> What speech can’t express, but that by which speech is expressed; what the mind can’t know, but that by which the mind is known; what sight can’t see, but that by which sight is seen; what hearing can’t hear, but that by which hearing is heard; what breathing can’t breathe, but that by which breath is drawn out – *that is alone is Brahman, and not what people venerate here.*

Wrong to focus overly on external rituals like fire, public social rites; must be inward rituals, asceticism
- Anti-establishment message

Atman/Brahman distinction
"quest for self" - "quest for fundamental knowledge of being" (framing, not distinct things)

Upanisads are not contradicting vedas (or the older vedas, since they are also a part of vedas) but saying focus exclusively on outer/external ritual is missing the point
→Other traditions entirely reject the vedas, ie. Buddha
- Buddha's view of Upan.: Codification of practices, but not "expressing knowledge necessary for liberation"
"Hindu" is a British term 


### Katha Upanisad (KTU) pp. 232-246
Origin of expression "razor's edge" (and inspiration for the novel)

Naciketas' father (brahmin) giving away all positions as sacrifice
Boy thinks he will be given away too, asks to whom– Father, in exasperation, says "to death": and has to follow through on his word
God of death Yama 
		Since he can’t take back his words, he tells Naciketas that, when he arrives at Death’s residence, Death will be away and Naciketas will have to stay there three days without food. Since it’s a great discourtesy to let a brahmin guest say in one’s house without food, Yama will have to grant him three wishes. 

First wish: Return to father's house alive 
Second wish: Explain how the fire-altar leads to heaven 
Third wish: Explain the mystery of death

***Answers:*** 
**Yama**
- *Even ancient gods had doubts, it's hard to understand*–make another wish, pick long life, pleasures
Naciketas refuses, says this knowledge is ephemeral 

**Yama**
- You have picked good over gratifying, knowledge over ignorance
- You have to understand "the primeval one" - atman 
	- Hidden in the cave of the heart (energetic seat of atman in the body)
- *Om* 
	- The sacred syllable, which expresses through its sound and structure *Brahman*
- The wise one {atman} is eternal, undying

*Some of the most famous lines of the upan. pp. 239-240* 
> If the killer thinks that he kills; 
> If the killed thinks that he is killed; 
> Both of them fail to understand, 
> He neither kills, nor is he killed. 
> Finer than the finest, larger than the largest is the self (ātman) that lies here hidden in the heart of a living being. 
> Without desires and free from sorrow, 
> a man perceives by the creator’s grace 
> the grandeur of the self.
> Sitting down, he roams afar. 
> Lying down, he goes everywhere. 
> The gods ceaselessly exulting— 
> Who, besides me, is able to know? 
> When he perceives this immense, all-pervading self, 
> as bodiless within bodies, 
> as stable within unstable beings— 
> A wise man ceases to grieve.

Inspires **Ralph Waldo Emerson**, trancendentalist - writes poem *Brahma* (meaning Brahman, misspelling because Brahma is a god and different thing)
> If the red slayer thinks he slays, 
> Or if the slain thinks he is slain, 
> They know not well the subtle ways 
> I keep, and pass, and turn again

Slain is not slain, killed is not killed - famous also because spoken by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita

**Imagery of the chariot: The structure of the knowing, embodied self**
*pp. 238-239*
> Know the self as a rider in a chariot, 
> and the body, as simply the chariot. 
> Know the intellect as the charioteer, 
> and the mind, as simply the reins. 
> 
> The senses, they say, are the horses, 
> and sense objects are the paths around them; 
> he who is linked to the body, senses, and mind, 
> the wise proclaim as the one who enjoys

- The embodied self (in life) is the rider
- the body is the chariot
- the intellect (discriminative knowledge/faculty of discrimination: telling between one thing and the next) is the charioteer
- the mind (that which integrates sensory information) is the reins
- and the senses are the horses (pulling us in different directions)
- the paths are the objects (the things the senses perceive)
- The one who has the body, senses, and mind is the one who enjoys–meaning, the one who *experiences* 

The charioteer is not the supreme controller because the *ultimate direction* comes from the rider 
Self is mostly a passive witness

*Samsara* = the round of rebirth, cycle of existence 

*The razor’s edge (p. 240)* 
> Arise! Awake! Pay attention, 
> when you’ve obtained your wishes! 
> A razor’s edge is hard to cross— 
> that, poets say, is the difficulty of the path. 
> It has no sound or touch, 
> no appearance, taste or smell; 
> It is without beginning or end, 
> undecaying and eternal; 
> When a man perceives it, 
> fixed and beyond the immense, 
> He is free from the jaws of death.

Negatives, without things 
Being reborn is not about living again but about dying again; dying another death

How do we perceive it? By reversing the outward projection and turning inward - 
*(p. 240)*
> “The Self-existent One pierced the apertures outward, therefore one looks out, and not into oneself. A certain wise man in search of immortality turned his sight inward and saw the self within” 

Apertures = senses
Yoga is the stilling of the turning of the mind: then, the pure seer/witness can abide in its own true form 
Stopping the horses running, then quieting the mind–first, calming it as it panics at the lack of senses, then the intellect stilled and quieted → *then, the one who is behind, the atman shines forth*
- Patanjali's Yoga sutras
- If you can abide by the dissolution and stilling then you can achieve liberation 

# 01.23.25 Lecture 6 - Mandukya Upanisad
![[Pasted image 20250123100857.png|70]]
### Mandukya Upanisad (MaU)
**End of the Upanisads**
#### Four "feet"/quarters of the self 
- 3 states of the self that we know: dreaming, dreamless, waking
- 3 phonemes of the sacred syllable OM (AUM in sanskrit)

**First Quarter: Vaisvanara** / A /
- *The universal one*
- Situated in the waking state
- Perceiving the outside 
- Enjoying "gross" (as in obvious) things 
- Coarsest, least subtle state
/ A /
- Lips open, coarsest sound


**Second Quarter: Taijasa** / U /
- *The brilliant one*
- Situated in the dream state
- Perceiving the inside 
- Enjoying refined things
/ U / 
- Subtler, sound – mouth narrows, more specific

**Third Quarter: Prajña** / M /
- Single mass of percep/consc./awareness
- Bliss
- Thought as mouth
- Lord of all, origin, dissolution of beings
- Closest to brahman
- Sankar believes it is possible to be lucid in deep sleep, interpenetration
- Departure of subject/object structure; ego dissolution, taste of oneness
	- Awareness of nothing but the self, but not as an object – *reflexivity*
/ M / 
- Lips come together, vibratory state
- Feels good 

**Fourth Quarter**  {AUM} / __ /
- Atman
- Indescribable, etc. 
- Perception of self alone

> Without a second

- Non-numerable one
- That which should be perceived/known/realized
- Debated if the fourth quarter is the whole syllable or silence
- Silence: Unmanifest, but the source from which all arises

*AUM is the self*

**Yoga**
- Disciplining and stilling the mind/body system so that *awareness* can manifest without obstruction 
- Practicing yoga → lucidity through *all three* states
	- Pure consciousness is the constant thread which runs through all states
	- If you can inhabit the perspective of pure awareness you can fully liberate mind and always be fully present

What is it that creates some continuity or connection between atman and the mind which is an object/subject in the physical world? 
Bc if karmic judgement (or goodness/badness of action) is to exist and memories of past lives can be accessed in some states then there is some kind of tie even if atman is untouched by good or bad 



# 01.28.25 Lecture 7  - Buddhism

[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 2 [2025].pdf]]
### Buddha (485-405 BCE)
"*The maximally awakened/enlightened one*"
Sanscrit/pali

Siddhartha: "one whos aim is accomplished"

There come to be more buddhas, so this buddha is identified specifically by Sakyamuni meaning of the Sakya clan

Artistic representations of Buddha influenced by Greek art (although this style came hundreds of years later)

Only accounts of buddha are from centuries later, orally transmitted

Oral preservation, based on metric structure + repetition, very robust–more so than writing 

Many verses begin with:
> "Thus have I heard..."
> "So I heard..."

Certifies as legit teaching bc/ remembered by Ananda

Disciples would gather for repetitions 

Buddha's teachings: 
- *Remembered*  = Sutras
- *Scholarly systematization* = Dharma

We don't have real concrete historical evidence of Buddha existing, akin to Homer 
→ We don't know which language he spoke, although it wouldn't have been Pali (which much is written in)

Corpus in Sanskrit has been lost, only preserved in the later Chinese translations of them 

##### Timeline
**Vedic period**: 1500-500 BCE
- Earliest Upanisad: 700 BCE
**Epic/Classical period**: 500 BCE - 500 CE
- Buddha emerges early in this period
**Medieval period**: 500-1500 CE
- Shankara: 700 CE
- Indian logic, theory of inference, epistemology emerging
- Islam enters India in this period

*China*: Warring states period
- Confucius/Konzi is travelling, advising states: 551-479
- Mengzi follower who continues and elaborates on Confucius: 372-289


Aśoka (emperor largely responsible for the spread of Buddhism in India.): 269-231 BCE

##### Biography
*compiled from later narratives about his life*
**Siddharta Gautama**
- Born in Sakya clan: Kapilavastu, W. Nepal near India
- Grows up comfortably, but leaves to become a sramana (recluse)
	- Later stories about him being a prince, although more likely he was not

Travels from one yoga master to another, attaining their highest level/most liberating yogic states, but he is unsatsifed as each one is temporary 

Takes up with ascetics who are extremely restrictive in eating, sleeping, to attain altered states–Buddha does this, but realizes it is killing him, so leaves

Through his own insights, attains awakening–*bodhi*–the realization of *Nirvana*

Doesn't want to teach bc/ he thinks ppl won't understand

Brama manifests in front of Buddha and begs him to teach what he has discovered 
- Implication about how Gods are as unable to attain liberation/understand how as people
- Positioning Buddha as superior to Vedic culture 

Story abt what he does: 
- First goes to his yogis; they have died
- Comes across recluse (name: Upaka), who believes in a spirituality of fate/determinism (not Vedic)
	- Recluse sees his state of calm says who taught you this?? Buddha says no one, I'll teach you – recluse says nah I'm good
- Buddhist texts positioning Buddha not only against Vedic but against other non-Vedic faiths

Decides to go teach for rest of his 45 years

Former ascetic friends receive Buddha's first teaching

**Historical context**
Brahmanism:
- Vedic ritual and sacrificial culture. 
- Upanishadic vision of ātman-brahman. 
Śramaṇas: 
- Deniers of karma and mokṣa (liberation) - (Ājīvīkas, materialists). 
- Jain asceticism

The Buddha rejects Brahmanism and the various Śramaṇic doctrines as misguided and not conducive to liberation. 

Instead, he propounds an original view based on the following radical ideas.

##### Fundamental ideas
Everything we experience is process—constant change with no unchanging essence.
- Everything is in flux

Process or change is not random; it is patterned according to various cause-effect *regularities*.

**Karma** is the *ethical* factor at work in these causal *regularities*, and it is fundamentally a mental factor—how volitions (intentions), wholesome and unwholesome, condition or affect the constantly changing processes of the world that we experience, aka, everything 
- {ethicization of karma}. 
- Action which arises out of desire/motivation, which begins in the mind 'stream'
- *Karma is intention*
- Good/bad effects contingent upon mental action/intention

Liberation from suffering is attainable through a combination of wisdom (right understanding), ethics (moral discipline), and meditation. 

*Evan's Cigarette Tale*
- Intention leads to action leads to habit
	- Like walking the same way on grass repeatedly, which over time changes the world as it becomes a path

Causality within mind stream as bad intentions lead to more bad intentions 
→ *The more you do something the more you're likely to do it, both internal and external* 

Buddha does not think there is an inner soul or spirit which is the author of the intention
Self is just a stream of mental events
#### Buddha's First Teaching

**The Middle Way** 
- The Dhamma (dharma in sanskrit) is a middle path between self-indulgence (society) and self-mortification (asceticism): Balance

**The Noble Eightfold Path** 
- The Dhamma as a path comprising right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness {sati in Pali: memory – mindfulness means *holding something in mind and not forgetting: keeping track of the mind*}, and right concentration {*remaining present and focused*}. 
- No 1:1 translation with english "meditation" – closest means "cultivation", as in, cultivating mindfulness and concentration

**The Four Noble Truths** (*aka, the right view in the Noble Eightfold*)
- Suffering, its origination, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation (the eightfold path leading to Nibbāna/Nirvāna). 

1. There is suffering (*dukha/duhkha*).
2. There is the origination of suffering {suffering comes into existence in dependence on causes}.
	1. Therefore, it is impermanent: it both arises and can cease → 
3. There is the cessation of suffering {all future suffering can be prevented}.
4. There is a path to the cessation of suffering {the Noble Eightfold Path}.

Medical format
Diagnosis: there is suffering, and it has a cause
Prognosis: it can cease
Prescription: this is how you stop it 

*List formats arise from systematization*

#### Four Noble Truths
##### There is suffering (dukha/duhkha)
- Not (just) ordinary pain, but existential suffering. 
- Traditionally described as *three-layered*, each more subtle than its predecessor.

1. Suffering as painful experiences. (most superficial)
	1. Immediate unpleasant sensation of hurting + mental reaction to it (worry, anguish, dread, frustration, etc.). 
2. Suffering as impermanence. 
	1. Nothing lasts, everything changes and is eventually lost, hence we’re always in pursuit of something new, anxiously knowing we’ll lose it too.
3. Suffering as due to conditions. (deepest)
	1.  Not getting what one wants; getting what one doesn’t want; getting what one wants and inevitably losing it. 
	2. Suffering due to the conditions that result in rebirth-redeath: craving, {literally:} thirst, desire, attachment.
		1. Everything is made of constituent parts which interact in undesirable ways (such as body)
		2. *Cyclicality*: every part of wheel is dependent on what came prior 

*Treadmill perspective:*
Whatever happiness one gains is outweighed by the inevitable loss, so that one has the sense of going nowhere, a sense that leads to alienation and despair
- Micro: From moment to moment, in the stream of the mind
- Macro: From life to life

#### Four Noble Truths cont.
##### The origin of suffering
Ignorance (warped way of knowing things/misunderstanding) where we ascrube permanent unchanging self to ourselves & essence to things→ Phenomenal self 
*Root of suffering = delusion of self* 
- Belief in perm. → craving for perm. = Constantly being thwarted by impermanence of life = root of suffering

##### Cessation of suffering
Because there is a cause, we can remove the cause and achieve liberation, "cure" suffering

> And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, nonattachment.

##### How does one cease suffering
Not just treat the symptoms but the underlying ccause, the attachment & cognitive delusion
*→ Noble eightfold path*

#### Noble Eightfold Path

1. Right view. 
2. Right intention. 
	1. *1, 2: Wisdom*
3. Right speech. 
4. Right action. 
5. Right livelihood. 
	1. *3, 4, 5: Moral Discipline*
6. Right effort. 
7. Right mindfulness. 
8. Right concentration.
	1. *6, 7, 8: Meditation*
All of these are interconnected w/ each other

Intention is that which moves the mind which motivates action

Livelihood should not derive from harmful profession (weapons trade, prostitution, butchery–although many buddhists not-vegetarian–)/*minimize harm to others*

Somewhat abstract, culturally dependent how to interpret these as a Buddhist

Meditation = training the mind, cultivating certain mental qualities/traits

Effort = actually trying to do all this, reminding self of purpose → view, intention, etc. 

Mindfulness = memory, keeping something in mind 
- First: mindfulness of the inbreath/outbreath
	- Trying this at first mind wanders from the *intented effort of mindfulness (3x!)* - but, then we notice we have wandered from our intention
		- *In cogsci terms* - Intended effort of attention is dynamic (breath is changing), the more attention the more we can notice the variation and its relation to our thoughts and feelings
		- Mindfulness includes process of "noticing" what you are attending to 
		- *In cogsci terms* - Meta awareness
		- Distractions are often salient; potent, grip which is difficult to escape even when you do have the intention
			- We have to notice and return without punishing self/disappointment which only perpetuates suffering → continue this wander/return cycle repetitively
- → Craving/mental thirst 

Concentration is implicit in mindfulness; sustained attention 

Once you have attained mindfulness of breathing → mindfulness of feeling → mindfulness of mental factors 

Meditation can only be practiced with moral discipline bc/ mindfulness must have solid virtuous intention, livelihood

*Path to freedom from suffering* 

Buddha says he has discovered these himself, not contained in vedas or upanisads, although upanisads has pieces of it
- Upanisads present freedom/liberation as atman/brahman unity, Buddha just as cessation of craving, although both stop the cycle of samsara/rebirth

### First of Buddha's teachings
[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 3 [2025].pdf]]

##### [[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=25&selection=4,0,7,18|THE WORLD IS EMPTY]]

Ananda = Buddha's disciple who follows him everywhere and remembers all his teaching 

*Emptiness = lack of a self*
- Emptiness returns often and with great significance

Everything (all that there is in the purview of experience)–vision, consciousness, bodily/experience–is empty of self → *the world is empty*

Monks & nuns go into village to beg for food, villagers support because it's considered good karma/auspicious to support a recluse, then return to monastery

>  “Monks, what do you think: do you consider **bodily experience** in this way: ‘This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self’?”
> "No sir"

We already know from upanisads that body ≠ self

> “Very good, monks! Bodily experience should not be considered in this way: ‘This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self,’ and instead it should be seen with correct understanding as it really is. What about perception, feelings, habitual traits, and con- sciousness? Do you regard them in this way: ‘This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self’?”
> “No, sir.”
> "Very good, monks!"


Aggregate = "heap" like pile of sand (in sanskrit)

#### The Five Aggregates
*Map of psycho-physical system, comprising these fluxuating parts, all of which are **empty of self***
1. **Forms**: Anything corporeal or physical - bodily experience, esp. from perspective of how it is experienced
2. **Feelings**: Sensations (all senses) - in Buddh., all feelings are *valenced* ('hedonic valence') - pleasure pain indiff.
3. **Perceptions**: Mental events which allow us to grasp/recognize something as basis for naming it
4. **Habitual traits**: Dispositions/intentions - cognitive and affective ways of being disposed to act in a certain way - inc. things like anger, compassion
5. **Consciousness**(es, plural): The fact of being aware, always in one of the 6 modes/senses - inc. visual, olfactory, auditory etc. all senses - & mental consciousness 

- In upanisads, there is a pure self-luminant consciousness
- Buddha's consciousness is based on certain mode of *being* consciousness 
	- ie. Mental consciousness/awareness of mental objects

##### [[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=31&selection=31,0,31,14|A LUMP OF FOAM]]
1. *Lump of foam* is "empty, hollow, and without essential substance" as is **bodily experience**
2. *Water bubble* is **feelings**
3. *Shimmering mirage* is **perception**
	1. you have attributed it perm and stability which it does not have; illusory 
4. *Plantain trunk* (without heartwood) is **habitual traits**
	1. Dispositions/mental qualities we have which condition psycho-phys system to be a certain way 
5. *Magician's illusion* is **consciousness** 
	1. Magicians would use "power of the mantra" to make a snake "appear" - apparition, illusion, fabrication - illusion = 'something that presents itself as being in a way that it isn't' (in Buddhism)

All without "essential substance", without self
- Essential substance being the thing that gives something constancy/permanence (atman, from upanisad perspective)

#### Self
Essence of the person or individual sentient being
Essence =  the one part whose continued existence is required for the person or individual sentient being to continue to exist (to be one and the same person/being over time).

e.g., my fifth birthday was experienced by the same me as I am now

**[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 3 [2025].pdf#page=5&selection=0,0,0,26|What do we mean by self?]]**

> To say that there is a self (in this precise sense) is to say that there is some one part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time. 
> 
> The person continues to exist as long as that self continues to exist.

>  The same person if and only if the same self. 
>  
>  “Same” here means numerically the same—one and the same thing.

In the day to day sense; "I" = person/individual being

But if there is a self- essential - then that is what "I" refers to, the part that is necessary for the continued existence of one and the same person 
- This part is "me", whereas other parts would be "mine" 
- What is "mine" may qualitatively change, but the "me" stays numerically the same
- "I" am the owner of these experiences; they are had by the numerically identical "me"
- So self as the essence of the person is also the owner of its changing mental and bodily states

#### No-self (anatman/anatta) 
Anatta = Pali

Buddha denies that there is a self, that is, that there is an essence of the person
The individual person/sentient being is said to lack an essence
We use "I" in everyday speech to pick out an individual being– the one speaking– but there is no essence "I" or "me" and hence no real owner of what we call "mine"

# 02.04.25 Lecture 9 Cancelled

# 02.06.25 Lecture 10 

#### No-self cont. 
*Five aggregates* leave nothing out: exhaustive of everything that makes up a person
- Constantly changing → no unchanging essence among five aggr.
- Contrast Upan.; atman/brahman 
- Self would have to be either essential or supreme controller, neither of which in five aggr.

#### Argument from impermanence

"The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving"
https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.038.than.html
- Buddha and Sati, the fisherman's son
- Sati says: Subject to karma
>  consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises

Consciousness is "of something" - not intangible

>  “And what is consciousness? … There are these six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose- consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. This is called consciousness.”

Series of momentary conscious events/mental events makes up a life  

#### Rebirth

> [!callout]  How can there be rebirth without there being something that is reborn? 
>
> A series of mental events carries on from this life to another one, with the last mental event at death *conditioning* (as consciousness dependent on condition) the next brith 

This is caused by ***dependent arising***
- **Karma** is a mental phenomenon which is included under the fourth aggregate (*habitual traits*)

##### Dependent arising
>  **Dependent arising**: a sequence, consisting of 12 links (factors) in a chain, over the course of three successive lives.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 10.26.05 AM.png|500]]

Appropriating these moments of life; the feeling of ownership over one's changing, non-self

##### *In summary (!!!QUIZ!!!!)*
**Basic logic:** 
- One is born into this life because in the last life one acted on the basis of volitions that were formed in ignorance. 
	- *Formed in ignorance (under the illusion of there being a permanent self)*
- Being born with a body means that one comes into contact with sense objects. 
	- *Whatever form you have has a sensory experience *
- This brings about feelings of pleasure, pain and indifference. 
	- *Senses → Feelings (pleasure, pain, indifference)*
- These feelings trigger desires. 
	- *Feelings → desire: our feelings cause us to be motivated in certain ways, desiring certain things*
- Desires conditioned by ignorance lead to appropriation: taking certain things as “me” or “mine.” 
	- *Desires → appropriation: "I" am oriented towards or away from things*
- And this fuels rebirth and produces suffering.
	- *Appropriation → rebirth, suffering*

This sequence occurs *w/o* core existing self: none of the elements are "self", so they don't sum to "self" either

Explains how the illusory sense of self arises thorugh the *causal workings* of *impersonally linked* mental and physical factors
	*→ Reductionism is an old, not modern, way of thinking*

# 02.11.25 Lecture 11 - Argument from control

**2 arguments for no-self: impermanence and *control***

#### Argument from (lack of) control
- References Upanisads, which refer to atman as supreme controller
- Aggregates are not subject to control → no self

- 1 If there were a self, it would be the inner controller
- 2-6 There is no ultimate control over {each aggregate}
- 7 Therefore, the five aggregates are not-self
- 8 There is no more to the person than the 5 aggregates 
	- → "exhaustiveness claim"
- 9 Therefore, the person is without self (empty of self)

Structurally, impermanence and control arguments are the same, but w/ diff criterion 

Buddha working w/ Upanisads/Vedas understanding of what self would be (if it existed)
	→ idea that the permanent self must have control
	→ but bc/ we try to change body, habits, etc: we don't have control over them, and that they aren't permanent/whole bc we can want more from each 

Question that arises: how can we follow the noble eightfold path and have right view, etc. if we have no control? 
	→ Buddha doesn't say there is *no* control, just not the way there would be with an inner controller - instead, there is a relative, conditioned control, whereby one part of the person (e.g. intention) influences another (e.g. perception)

*Buddha, as awake one, generates no karma*
- "Awakening w/ remainder": awakened one w/ body & old karma → gets rid of old karma at death
- "Awakening w/o remainder": awakened one w/o body 
	- Living w/o karma or intention
- Buddha as flow state system which only resembles its intention but actually just acts
- We can't really conceive of Buddha in awakened state
	- Compassion robot, wish-fulfilling jewel %%????? ask Izzy%%
- Buddha sees control in unawakened beings as a matter of impermanent and "shifting coalitions" of control factors (belonging principally to the *habitual traits* aggregate) and not of an inner controller (unchanging essence)

##### More Buddha depth - some history
Sigghartha Gautma (the Buddha) c. 500-400 BCE
- Sutta Pitaka (discourses)
- Vinaya Pitaka (code of discipline)
→ Splits into 18 Abhidharma schools , one is Theravada, school of elders, famous teacher Buddhagosa 
- Lots of related schools lost to us/ceased to exist
Prajnaparamita "perfection of wisdom" literature - linked to rise of Manayana school - supposed ot be teachings the Buddha kept hidden for awhile till people were ready 
- key teacher **Nagarjuna** 
	- First named Buddhist philosopher after the Buddha, 100-200 CE
- key figure Bodhisattva (the returner)

**Philosophical arguments for no-self:**
- **Vajira** in "verses of sister vajra" (sutta-discourse)
	- Vajra was bhukkhini- female monk
	- Goes to sit in the Dark Forest for a nap and *Mara, the Evil one*, appraoches her and asks her: "where does a person come from? originate? cease?"
	- She recognizes Mara, that personification of evil mental distracter, and responds: "why assume a self? Mara, you have adopted a wrong view. 'this is only a heap of processes.' (aggregate) Just as the word 'chariot' refers to an assemblage of parts, so 'person' is a convention used when the aggregates are present." 
		- Only suffering arises or ceases. Nothing other than suffering; no person
	- Mara realizes Vajra knows him, and is miserable-- the teaching of no-self *vanquishes him on the spot*
- "Why a person is like a chariot" - **Nagasena** teaching
	- From The Questions fo King Milinda (dialogue), 100 BCE - 200 CE
	- King Milinda says what's your name, Nagasena gives his name but says no person is found here → 
	- *Chariot analogy*
		- 1. The chariot–or any other complex whole–is either:
			- i) identical to one of its parts
			- ii) identical to all of its parts together
			- iii) something distinct from its parts
		- 2. It is not the case that i, ii, or iii is true 
		- 3. It is not the case that the chariot has no existence whatsoever
		- 4. The chariot has only a *conventional* existence – "chariot" as conventional designation, w/in conventional reality
	- Can't be identical to all its parts: couldn't be if they were in disarray, nor each single part that makes it up, parts are many, collectively, and chariot is one (and many≠one), 8 parts can change w/o whole changing. 
	- Can't be distinct from its parts: can't have parts in one place and chariot in another, not able to exist w/o parts – chariot & parts supervene
	- *Premise 4.* 
		- i) there are chariot parts
		- ii) there is a shared practice of using the word 'chariot' to pick out such groups of parts
		- iii) this practice is useful for our purposes
	- Emptiness ≠ nothing–not utter nonexistence, j. conventional reality
	- *Emptiness = phenomena that lack something*
	- Later Buddhism says all phenomena are essenceless
		- Idea of chariot being defined by function–what function do humans have? many! so, functional to be described conventionally
		- Some schools talk about minimally simple existents, instantaneous quality occurences, flashes of what makes up 5 agg.
			- Not substance, & small enough that you can't continue to split
			- Everything else is a *mental construction* to see extension and action etc.
		- Buddha doesn't say that but some schools do → Nagarjuna critiuqes, says even those tiny things would be empty → all empty position = reductio ad absurdum
			- King Milinda text predates Nagarjuna

[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 4 [2025].pdf]]
#### The argument from complex wholes (chariot argument)
[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 4 [2025].pdf#page=8&selection=0,0,2,17|Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 4 [2025], page 8]] 

#### 2 truths: "Ways of Talking About This"
##### Conventional
IFF it is acceptable to common sense and consistently leads to successful practice
##### Ultimate
IFF it corresponds to the facts and neither asserts nor presupposes the existence of any conventional realities

*Ultimately* there is no Nagasena but *conventionally* there is Nagasena; same with chariot: 

##### The chariot (complex whole) principle
> Whatever has constituents depends upon these constituents for its existence, and depends upon our conceiving this "many" as a "one" for its unity, and so does not exist ultimately, but only (at best) conventionally

What is conventionally real is at best constructed (constructivists) → samsara is a conceptual construction

Any concept is both positive and negative
- Like a grid which chunks certain things into a slot and excludes certain things from that slot
- What we do or don't consider as inclusion/exclusion criteria is conventional, not ultimate

***→ Application to the self*** 
- The self depends on the five aggregates
- It depends on conceiving these aggregates as a unity
- It therefore does not exist ultimately, only conventionally
- "Self" is a conventional designation

***→ Nothing complex can be ultimately real, because it depends on its constituents: it exists only conventionally***

Grass fire sweeping across a hill:
- Appears to be moving from one place to the next, but is instead a series of *causally linked* instantaneous moments 
#### Candrakirti's sevenfold reasoning
*Introduction to the Middle Way*
5 centuries after the King and Nagasena
In the line of **Nagarjuna** 

##### Ascertaining the object to be negated
An inherently existent self, either corresponding to the innate feeling of self, or an artificial conception based on an intellectually acquired theory about the nature of phenomena
- Conception of self that we acquire, relating to theory about nature of phenomena
- Distinct but interrelated
- Such a self would exist objectively, ind. of thought  
- Object of negation is *not* the conventionally existent person

***Seven → Two*** 
Either 1) the self is identical to the aggregates, or 2) the self is different from the aggregates
→ Either the self is the same as its bases of imputation, or it is different 

Neither makes sense, so the self does not exist inherently but is only *mentally imputed* %%imputed: ascribed%%

The analysis (sevenfold reasoning) = "analytical meditation" applied to the object of negation, so as to uproot the innate feeling of self

**Inferential cognition**
- (Example from Indian philosophy) From the valley, you look to the mountains and see smoke: the inference is that there is fire in the mountains because there is smoke: you perceive one thing, you know that wherever there is smoke there is fire (regularity), so you infer there is fire without seeing it 
- When you practice this meditation, you generate inferential cognition where you perceive the five aggregates, then you infer the absence of self 
- Direct realization: you *realize, experience* the truth of no self without inference

**Madhyamaka** (Middle Way): According to Candrakirti's *Middle Way*, the same reasoning applies universally: 
***All phenomena are empty of inherent existence and exist only conventionally***

__ thinkers say there is no difference between conventional and ultimate

**Nagarjuna** says there is *no difference* between samsara and **nirvana**

# 02.25.25 Lecture 13 - Nirvana 
#### [[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 5 2025.pdf]]
https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN35_28.html
Nibbana (Pali)/Nirvana 
Moving to zen (chan, in org. Chinese) Buddhism
### Fire sermon
"The way of putting things as being on fire"
Fire as metaphor
"All is burning," everything is on fire 
- Describing things as if they are on fire/in terms of how they are burning
Everything = totality of experience: 
- 6 senses, 
- their objects, 
- their operation/functioning via contact, 
- 6 consciousness based on senses, objects, contact, 
- 6 types of associated feelings

*Psychologizes karma* 

#### The fire is threefold (the defilements)
- Passion (greed, lust)
	- Desiring (for oneself)
- Hatred
	- Wishing ill (in relation to oneself)
- Delusion
	- Root ignorance; thinking you have a self 
	- Intertwined with passion and hatred


Nibbana/Nirvana = "going out" = extinguishing fire
- Intransitive (not implying any agent which causes the going out: happens in *correct conditions*) form of verb "va", to blow, with prefix nir → cease to burn
	- Notion of agency must cease
	- Once fuels for fires; passion, hatred, etc. cease, fire goes out
	- Understanding 4 noble truths, 8fold bath, etc., but not action specifically to "put out"; act in such a way as to ... 

*Why three?* 
- Buddha is taking Vedic ideas; brahmin householder has duty to keep lit and tend daily to three ritual fires, which came to symbolize life in the world, as a householder–world would degenerate into chaos w/o this ritual
In one sutta, Buddha reinterprets the fires in this positive way: 
- Eastern fire for one's parents
- W for household, dependents
- S for holy men, worthy to receive offerings 
- "tend the fires" by supporting people–living one's life
In "fire sermon", negative interpretation: he psychologizes fire as negative states of mind:
- Passion (greed, lust)
- Anger
- Hatred
	Existential sickness

##### Relating to five aggregates
- FFPHC
	- forms feelings perceptions habitual traits consciousnesses
Buddha says that suffering is the "five aggregates of grasping"
- Comparison to the feeling of intense thirst after long hot hike, being unable to stop yourself from continuing to drink cool water
- The word trans. as "grasping" (upadana) more concretely means "*fuel*"
- Each of the five aggregates is likened to a bundle of fuel, of firewood

##### Connection to Nirvana
- "Going out" of the three fires via elimination of craving and ignorance
- Teaching w/in framework of karma and rebirth – death is **not** the going out of the fires, although one fire is not the same as the next – causal series, each flame giving rise to next 
- Extinguishing can only happen in life; Nirvana can only be realized in *life*
- Once extinguished, the five aggr. persist but are no longer burning; 
- When the five aggr. cease to exist–when the awakened person dies–all fuel is gone and no rebirth occurs

#### Nirvana
- Nirvana is qualitatively different; there is no "backsliding" from it 
- Arahant/arahat–someone who attained nirvana by following Buddha's path
- Buddha–someone who attained nirvana themselves

*Do those who have attained nirvana exist after death, or no longer?* 
Buddha rejects the presupposition; 
> “is reborn,” “is not reborn,” “is both reborn and not reborn,” and “neither is reborn nor not reborn,” “do not apply,” i.e., none of them is applicable or can express how things are. (see https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html)

##### Two modes of description for nirvana

| Psychological                                                                                                             | Metaphysical                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Destruction of passion, anger, hatred.                                                                                    | Transcendent state that is “unborn, unmade, unbecome, and unconditioned.”             |
| Elimination of craving and ignorance. Resultant exalted feeling of psychological well-being.                              | Inexpressible in positive language; indicated through negative expressions (as above) |
| Genuine peace and happiness, pervaded by loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, equanimity (*four “Divine Abodes”*) |                                                                                       |
Not blissful, as atman/brahman realization is described; exhaltation

*Brahma* is the god who comes to Buddha and encourages him to teach the world about attaining nirvana 
- Buddha says that the true *abodes of Brahma* are the *four divine abodes*

***Quiz 3 will be on Chan Buddhism*** 
#### [[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 6 2025.pdf]]

Chan Buddhism is a form of Mahayana Buddhism – "the greater vehicle"
"Perfection of wisdom" literature

 Buddhism is a missionary religion 

Teravada (only surviving form of its branch, more southern) is called by Mahayana Thinayana "lesser vehicle" 

### Mahāyāna Buddhism 
Prior, sutras typically featured the Buddha speaking, as a human man
*~100BCE, a new kind of Buddhist sūtra starts to appear:* 
- Sometimes it’s Gautama Buddha who is represented as speaking; sometimes it’s another Buddha who abides in a heavenly paradise (e.g., the “celestial Buddha,” Amitābha); sometimes it’s a bodhisattva. 
	- Bodhisattva decides not to choose liberation in order to inform more people
- The setting is sometimes India, sometimes another world. 
- The teachings differ from those of the earlier sūtras in certain distinctive ways


#### Mahayana sutras
**Prajñapāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom)** 
- Emphasizes transcendent wisdom 
	- Sotereological ideas (concerned with liberation)
**Lotus sūtra** 
- One vehicle, many teachings; Buddha didn’t pass into final nirvāṇa but is still active in the world. 
**Avatamsaka (Flower Ornament)** 
- Emphasizes interpenetration of all things 
- Everything is what it is because its related inextricably to everything else — dependent arising cont. 
**Laṅkāvatāra (Entry to Laṅkā)** 
- Teaches “mind only” doctrine, says words aren’t important for transmission of the dharma 
	- Ultimate teaching is ineffable
**Vimalakīrti sūtra** 
- Emphasizes nonduality
	- Bodhisattva 
	- Teaches to monks, goddess comes to visit 

#### Distinctive ideas of Mahayana Buddhism 
*Sravakayana: Arhat/arahant (the accomplished person)*
- Practices the Noble Eightfold path
- Attains awakening in this life as a result of hearing/practicing Buddha's teachings
- No longer sets in motion anything that will cause the personal factors of existence (5 aggr.) to arise in the future; *nirvana without remainder* – upon death attains nirvana with no body

##### 1. Mahayana: Bodhisattva (awakened being)
- Someone who will become a Buddha but vows to be reborn until all other beings are liberated, and undertakes to help them attain liberation (Bodhisattva vow)
- Understands noble eightf0ld as also including practice of **Six Perfections**: generosity, self-restraint, patience, energy, concentration, and insight
- *Idea of ultimate selflessness: full liberation is liberation of all beings, not just self*
- → Thinks arhat has residual attachment to self by achieving only one's own liberation 
- → Universal compassion

##### 2. Emptiness (*sunyata, śūnyatā*)
> **Dharma**: technical term in scholastic Buddhist philosophy; referring to *ultimately real, irreducable element of existence*

- All **dharmas** are empty of svabhava (own-being, intrinsic being, intrinsic nature, essence)
- → reductionist, microprocess view
- The lack or abscence of intrinsic nature in any and all phenomena, the final nature of things, (dharmata), and the ultimate truth 
##### 3. Buddha-nature
#### Prajnaparamita/Prajñapāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom)

Radical, transformative insight; the intuitive, immediate, direct, nondiscursive knowledge of emptiness

The shortest is the "**Heart Sutra**" – for the heart of the perfection of wisdom

*From* https://lapislazulitexts.com/tripitaka/T0251-LL-prajnaparamita-hrdaya/
 - For Mahayana, it is central conundrum to grapple with 
- Chan/zen return over and over to paradox

[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 6 2025.pdf#page=13&selection=0,0,2,6|Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 6 2025, page 13]]
#### The Mahāpariṇirvāna sutra/Great Parinirvana sutra
- Set at the time of the Buddha's passing (dying of dysentary, in pain)

Asserts that: 
- All beings have an intrinsic pure nature of which they will become fully aware once things obscuring it have been removed
- All possess a 'seed' or potential for buddhahood
- The Mahayana path to buddhahood is open to all

#### Buddha-nature
> The inherent potential of all sentient beings to attain buddhahood
> Human beings especially suited to realize the possibility of awakening given combo of intelligence and suffering

- Can be traced back to one of the perfection of wisom sutras,  the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñapāramitā Sūtra
- There it is said that the mind is *fundamentally luminous*
- This in turn has an antecedant in the Pali statement "The mind, O monks, is luminous but defiled by adventitious defilements"

Leads to the development of related doctrines: 
- “Womb of the Tathāgatas” (tathagatagarbha) 
- “Immaculate consciousness” (amalavijñāna)
	- Defilements come from outside; mind is inherently pure (see "the mind, O monks")

**Womb of the Tathāgatas** 
- A concept equivalent to buddha-nature. 
- The subject of extensive discussion and debate, especially because some descriptions make it seem similar to ātman.

Relevance to Chan/Zen: Bodhisattva, emptiness, buddha-nature, luminous mind, womb of the tathagatas, immaculate consciousness → all *crucial to Chan/Zen*

### **Nagarjuna** 
First named Buddhist scholar after the Buddha
Hugely important for the rest of Indian, Chinese, Tibetan Buddhist philosophy
Philosopher of the Middle Way & emptiness

#### Nagarjuna's central concept
- The *emptiness* of intrinsic nature
- The concept of emptiness is central to the Prajnaparamita literature
- The concept of intrinsic nature is central to *Abhidharma* phil → defines what is ultimately real 
- Using reductio ad absurdum (prasanga) arguments, Nagarjuna aims to show that there is *no* intrinsic nature → *no* ultimately real things → *no* dharmas in the *Abhidharma* sense

Abdhidharma phil use reductionist argument from Buddha's "no self" 

→ impersonal quality particulars, analogous to physicists reducing to particle physics 

**Abhidharma**
To exist w/ intrinsic nature (svabhāva) means to be part of the basic furniture of the world, independent of anything else
Dharmas (momentary quality particulars) only ultimately real thing
→ Absolute ontological foundation, end point in chain of ontological dependence relations

**Madhyamaka**
There is no such end point: no ultimately real foundation
Everthing is "empty" of intrinsic nature 
Upon analysis nothing existw sw intrinsic nature so nothing is ultimately real 

Non-essentialism: phenom are empty of an essence/intrinsic nature
Non-foundationalism: phenom are empty of an inherently existent foundation or ground

***Soteriological import***
*Svabhāva* is not just theoretical posit; it's our default cogn. mode of experience
We superimpose onto our self and the outerworld the delusion that things have intrinsic nature
- Delusion is fundamental ignorance; craving & attachment to self → deep-seated cause of suffering/dukkha

Awakening is the *direct experiential realization of emptiness; śūnyatā*

**Arguments against svabhāva**
- Nagarjuna doesn't give one "master argument" for absence of intrinsic nature; he examines a variety of claims made by those who take there to be ultimately real entities 
- His strategy is to show each claim *cannot* be true → purely *negative* arguments

***Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*** (MMK) comprises 27 chapters, each of which examines a distinct topic and shows via *negative* argument that it cannot be ultimately real
1. Conditions. 
2. Motion. 
3. The senses. 
4. The aggregates.
5. The elements. 
6. Desire and the one who desires.
7. The conditioned. 
8. Agent and action.
9. What is prior.
10. Fire and fuel. 
11. The prior and posterior parts (of saṃsāra).
12. Suffering. 
13. The Composite.
14. Conjunction/Connection. 
15. Intrinsic nature/essence. 
16. Bondage and liberation. 
17. Actions and their fruits. 
18. The self. 
19. Time. 
20. Assemblage/combination. 
21. Arising and dissolution (of existents). 
22. The Tathāgata. 
23. False conception/errors. 
24. The Four Noble Truths. 
25. Nirvāṇa. 
26. The twelve links (of dependent origination). 
27. Views.

Single crucial line of reasoning: Incompatability between svabhāva and dependent arising/origination.

##### Dependent origination 
###### MMK 24: 18-19
> 18 . Dependent origination we declare to be emptiness. It [emptiness] is a dependent concept; just that is the middle path. 
>19 . There being no dharma whatsoever that is not dependently originated, it follows that there is also no dharma whatsoever that is non-empty. -- Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura, Nāgārjuna’s Middle Way, pp. 277-288.

Whatever is dependently co-arisen can be explained by emptiness

###### *Comparison with Abhidharma* 
**Abhidharma** 
- Whatever has parts depends upon them for its existence, and depends upon our conceiving this “many” as a “one” for its unity, and therefore does not exist ultimately, but only (at best) conventionally. 
- For Abhidharma, although a dharma (e.g., “seeing-blue-consciousness”) depends on other dharmas (the contact dharma, the dharmas making upon the organ of sight, etc.) for its occurrence, it doesn’t require anything else for its being that dharma. It has its nature or being intrinsically. 

**Nāgārjuna** 
- Anything dependent on another for its existence does not have any independent being or nature or identity of its own.
- Nāgārjuna’s principle is stronger than the Abhidharma one 
- The causal dependence of the dharma is taken to imply that it cannot have any intrinsic being or nature. 
- It follows that no conditioned dharma can have an intrinsic nature, hence there can be no conditioned dharmas in the Abhidharma sense (no momentary quality-particulars with their own intrinsic nature).

Nagarjuna needs to show that any kind of causal dependency impugns the intrinsic nature of a dharma in just the way that the conceptual dependency of complex wholes impugns their ultimate reality; he does this by showing that *causal dependency is itself a conceptual construction, and hence that causal dependence implies conceptual dependence*

#### Causation argument against Svabhava – first verse of MMK:
> Not from itself, not from another, not from both, nor without cause: Never in any way is there any existing thing that has arisen. Siderits & Katsura] 
> 
> Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise. Garfield]

Assumption: the cause (or the entity that is the cause) and the effect (") have an intrinsic nature – each is intrinsically real. Given this, there are four possibilities: 
Things can be produced:
1. From themselves
2. From other things
3. From both themselves and other things
4. From neither

##### 1. From themselves/Self-Causation
- Not buddhist view, some Hindu phil beleive this

Suppose that cause and effect are the same object - the pot one second ago is the cause of the present pot 
- But causes precede their effects and no entity can be temporally prior to itself
- If we say that the past time slice causes the present time slice, then the time slices are different temporal parts, which means that cause and effect are no longer the same
- But this entails that when the cause is present, so is the effect, contrary to our usual asusmption that the cause brings about the effect at a later time
- Also, what would be the point of production if the effect is already contianed in the cause? 
- Also, if we investigate the constituents of the causal field (gas, spark, etc), we do not find the effect (explosion)

##### 2. From other things
- But the effect depends *existentially* on the cause (if the cause did not exist, the effect would not exist), and the cause depends *notionally* on the effect (if there was no effect, the cause would not qualify as cause)
- If there were two entities that were ultimately real, they could not be connected by a dependence relation, so they could not be related as cause and effect

***"Argument of the three times"***
%%We don't need to know his particular args theyre just fun%%
> MKK 1: 5-6: 
> 5 They are said to be conditions when something arises dependent on them. When something has not originated, why then are they not non-conditions? 
> 
> 6 Something cannot be called a condition whether the object that is the supposed effect] is not yet existent or already existent.

... 

##### 3. From both themselves and other things
- As conjunction of 1 & 2, suffers from the same problems

##### 4. From neither
- Undermines the idea of causality, bc/ it implies that anything comes from anything else 

##### Upshot:
It follows that the relation of causation or production must be conceptually constructed: 
- *Thinking in causal terms requires drawing together distinct things–the "cause" and the "effect"–and thinking them as "one" while at the same time keeping them distinct.*
- But thinking of something multiple as "one" in this way is, by the Abhidharma's own criterion, conceptually constructed. 

Causation is something we impute upon observing a regular succession of events; it is conventionally but not ultimately real 

Causal dependence implies conceptual dependence; which implies the absence of an intrinsic nature– a nature independent of conceptual construction

Hence dependent origination implies emptiness:
*Return to MMK 24: 18-19*

Implications: If there is no ultimate reality, there is only conventional reality 

Emptiness is therefore also not ultimately real; it is the absence of ultimate reality, which is to say only conventionally existent

# 03.06.25 Lecture 16 - MMK 

[[0 PHIL 470#MMK 24 18-19]]

Conceptual awareness → non-conceptual awareness?

All dharmas are empty = no ultimate reality, including of emptiness; emptiness is empty/conventionally existent

Emptiness and the phenomenal world are two characterizations of the same thing

###### Mūlamadhyamakakārikā 25: 19-20 
> 19 *There is no distinction whatsoever between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa*. There is no distinction whatsoever between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra. 
> 20 *What is the limit of nirvāṇa, that is the limit of saṃsāra.* There is not even the finest gap to be found between the two. 
> -- Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura, Nāgārjuna’s Middle Way, p. 302.

Concentionally, there is a difference, and we should still seek nirvana and cessation of samsara - ultimately, no inherent difference

*"It is the person who enters nirvāṇa, but as a state of being, not as a place to be"* 
-- Jay Garfield

"Not one not two"
-- Mahayana expression that becomes central to Chan/Zen

My q: How is there no reality but conventional reality and nirvana/samsara are conventionally different but are also ultimately the same because they are empty? Tangled? 

Yes, tangled. 
We need to be using logics that allow for confirmation? 
- Dialetheists; allowing for contradictions -- Jay Garfield would argue Nagarjuna should be interpreted this way
- Tibetan interp; parameterization -- 

### Vasubandhu
One of the most infl buddist phil
4-5th c CE
-- revisit slides he hasn't posted yet

"Thirty Verses" Trimsika
"Thirty Verses on Impression Only" Trimsika Vijnaptimatrata

Grasper-grasped or subject-object structure is an illusory contruction of the mind; 
liberation consists in a direct intuitve realization that sees things in their suchness beyond the sub-obj split


Diff name, same phil movement; 

**Yogacara**; the practice of yoga
- Indicates its concerns are close to meditation practice and phil reflection on that practice
**Vijnanavada**; doctrine of consciousness 
- Central concern w consciousness and adds 2: 
	- Manas; menal consciousness/though, typically afflictive. "I"/"I am" in essential self-sense
	- Alayavijnana: store consciousness 
**Cittamatra**: mind only
- All obj are "mind only"/of the nature of mind -- idealism? 
**Vijnaptimatra**; impressions only 
- Indicates its central claim that all obj are "impressions only"

#### Vasubandhu: Yogacara model of consciousness 
*6 external bases; 6 internal bases; 6 consciousnesses*
- Visible forms, smells, mental objects, etc.
- Eye, ear, nose, mental faculty, etc.
- Eye consciousness, ear consciousness etc. 

##### Levels of consciousness 
Conscious attn to one's own states of mind (mano-vijnana) → 
Thought, consciousness of a self, pre-attentitve mdoe of self-awareness (manas) → 
- Feeling of remembering, neutral
- *Afflictive* manas: sense of being/having a self
Store (base) consciousness (alaya-vijnana)
- 'Storehouse w/ seeds' -- latent tendencies, disp. which can become *activated depending on circ.* 
- Carries over from one life to next
- Can think of like unconsciousness -- like freudian or jungian unconsciousness -- deep repository
- In ignorant, deluded, mind, these are structured around the sense of self/subj-obj form 

Arrows represent *dependencies*; conscious attn depends on pre-attentive, which depends on store/base consciousness 

Meditation practice aims for; Meditative states which shut down inner workings of mind, slow heart beat, breathing → some practitioners can enter these states and choose to exit after a certain period of time
- Deeper level of mind that can be alive and has some amount of voluntary control, beyond mental consciousness which shuts down (store consciousness)
	- "Under the hood deep cogn engine" 
	- Karma; acts plant more seeds, reinforcing tendancies/disp.n
	- Store consciousness "runs on karma"
- Goal: Weaken grip of subj/obj structure and purify mind

Store consciousness is debated, Madhyamaka doesn't believe


> [!example] Chan text

3rd quiz is gonna be on Chan 
Few lecture notes bc we are doing readings in class → gotta show up buh 

# 03.11.25 Lecture 17 - Yogacara model 
[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 8 [2025].pdf#page=14|Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 8 [2025], page 14]]
*Klista* = tainted, afflicted
Thought - *manas* - tainted with sense of self
Nothing is "going" from one moment to the next; seeds
![[Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 9.35.59 AM.png|400]]

Store consciousness brings rise to conscious experience; its workings are inaccessible consciously, but its contents are conscious 
*Subj Obj structure is within the workings of mental consciousness itself*
- Unawakened experience is always structured this way, except for rare circumstances where it could be removed (trance, psychs)
#### Vasubandhu
>  There are “three natures,” each with its own corresponding type of “naturelessness."
##### The Three Natures
If something falls w/in category, it is conceptually constructed

**Nature** 
1. The imagined nature. 
	1. *How we take things to be, given our cogn/affective biases*
	2. The imagined, subject/object, inner/outer structure. 
	3. Natures that are mind only
2. The dependent nature. 
	1. *Underlying causal structure*
	2. The flow of impressions only, dependent on causes and conditions, especially the store-consciousness. 
	3. Natures that are series of mind moments 
3. The perfected nature.
	1. Beyond all conceptualization. (Nagarjuna would say this is no different from conventional reality; Yogacara would not quite)
	2. Realization of the *dependent nature as empty of the imagined nature*
		1. No more S/O struct 

- Everything is of these natures
- "Mind-only" discipline

***Naturelessness - Yogacara perspective*** 
1. Lack of intrinsic/defining characteristics.
	1. Lack of S/O struct
2. Lack of independence. 
	1. Corresponding to dependent nature; everything is dependently originated
3. Lack of differentiation, beyond all subject-object characterization and conceptualization.

Yogacara find mandyamaka too extreme in a way which leads to nihilism; and don't regard the mind enough

Experience is *not* a separate phenom. which 'belongs' to subj, given lack of S/O structure
- relational matrix/network of mental & environmental processes/interdependent web
- Perfected nature is the realization of that web as beyond S/O structure

### Chan Buddhism
[[Comparative Conceptions of the Self Slides 9 [2025].pdf]]

- **Chán** 禪 is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit *dhyāna*, usually translated as “meditation." (or; concentration)
- **Chán zōng** 禪宗 = “School of Meditation.” 
- Generally known in English as “Zen Buddhism."
	- First representatives in West were Japanese zen buddhists

Origin: **Flower sermon**
- Mahayana text
- Later text that gives mythic origin story for Chan 
#### Bodhidharma

![[Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 10.32.44 AM.png|300]]
- Bodhidharma: first Chan patriarch
- Indian monk who arrived in China 5-6 c. CE
- We don't know much about him apart from later scriptures which present him 
	- Always presented as having big eyes (one legend that he kept dosing off during meditation and ripped off his eyelids out of frustration)
##### Flower Sermon
- Buddha gives wordless teaching by holding up a flower
	- → *Mind is beyond language*
- No one understands except Mahakasyapa/Mahākāśyapa who smiles.

> The true Dharma is not found in words, but is a special transmission outside the scriptures, which I entrust to Mahākāśyapa.

Importance of *gestures, behaviors* 

**Saying attributed to Bodhidharma**
> A special transmission outside the scriptures
> not relying on words
> pointing directly to the human heart-mind {xīn: either heart or mind}
> seeing one's own nature and attaining Buddhahood

Both Chan selections in How to lose yourself are apocryphally {doubtfully} attributed to Bodhidharma but composed later in 8th c by writers in Oxhead lineage of Chan
- Oxhead buddhism very infl. by *mind-only* ideas and "*sudden*" awakening
	- Gradual vs sudden awakening - doctrinal difference
	- Gradual = 8fold path
	- Sudden = if you practice by fastening onto practices, scriptures, doctrine, you have become too attached to concepts
		- Meditation is not path to awakening; it *is* awakening

Metaphysical questions about what the mind is
Background Buddhist influence 

#### Rebirth
> Since the master has said that a mind cannot be located anywhere, it should follow that there are no such things as good or evil actions. In that case, why do living beings continue to transmigrate among the six realms of rebirth (hell beings, ghosts, animals, humans, spirits, and gods), being reborn and dying without end?
> [[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=157&selection=12,0,12,4|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 157]]

Reborn in a realm that manifests your hatred filled state of mind 

If there is no mind how could there be hell? 

Only extreme outliers of humanity will be reborn as hellbeing or godbeing
Hungry ghosts -- hellbeings

Animals; sentient, but incapable of self-control -- if you live a life that reflects no self-control, reborn as animal 

Gods think they're incredible, immortal, but they're deluded -- eventually your state of mind will be reflected in the realm you live 
- They don't realize they will "use up fuel that keeps you in the bliss realm" and become human
- Comparably difficult to become enlightened as hellbeing (constant torture) and godbeing; this is why humans are so ideal for enlightenment

Yogacara is very fundamentally mind-oriented

Buddha "acts" without karma ("acts" in quotes bc/ not really action w/0 karma)

> People are bewildered and imagine there is a mind where there is none. Engaging in all kinds of activity, they ignorantly cling to the existence of mind and thus end up transmigrating among the six realms, being reborn and dying without cease. It is like someone who, in the dark, mistakes a stump for a ghost or a rope for a snake; they are immediately filled with dread. The imaginative constructions of people are the same.

[[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=157&selection=31,0,37,23|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 157]]

Replace mind with self and boom back to classics

Imagined snake, ghost -- projecting an image on a real perception (rope, tree stump) → same for mind, projected 

Realizing mindlessness through meditation, ending samsara, all wrongful actions are eliminated

##### Page 141

>  Like shining a ray of light into a dark place—the darkness imme- diately vanishes. In the same way, if you realize that there is no mind, then your past transgres- sions are immediately eliminated.

> Q: I suppose I am just stupid, as I still don’t get it. As for someone who functions in the world using their six senses, who speaks in response to questions, who engages in all kinds of activities, who is deemed to be either deluded or awakened, who is subject to transmigration through life and death or is liberated—does such a person really not have a mind at all?

- If there is no mind, who is transmigration, delusion, happening to ?

> A: Such a person really does not have a mind! It is only because living beings imagine themselves as having minds that they are said to be deluded and subject to life and death, or awakened and liberated. 

[[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=159&selection=23,0,39,21|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 159]]

- "They are said to be deluded" -- way of talking, where beings are deluded, awakened, subj. to life/death -- there is no fundamental thing that is delusion because one's fundamental nature is Buddha-nature

>  If one realizes that there is in fact no mind, then there is no such thing as delusion, life and death, or liberation

[[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=159&selection=27,10,29,29|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 159]]

- Paradox at play

> Therefore, for the benefit of those who hold to the existence of a mind, the Buddha spoke of life and death as if they were real. 

[[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=159&selection=29,31,39,21|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 159]]

- Implicit distinction between conventional and ultimate 
- Buddha, for benefit of unawakened beings, used the conventional language by which we talk about mind 
	- {Like talking to a little kid in a certain way- although one must be careful that they don't catch on and throw it back}

##### Page 143
> “Awakening” only has meaning in contradistinction to “delusion,” and “liberation” only has meaning in contradistinction to “life and death.” 
>  Such teachings are mere antidotes intended for a specific disease; once you grasp the absence of mind, then neither delusion nor awakening can be found. And the same holds for life and death and liberation— they too are ungraspable.

- Back to 4 noble truths
- Disease is suffering, existential disease of samsara
- Cause is delusion 
- Remedy is noble 8fold

> And the same holds for life and death and liberation— they too are ungraspable.

[[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=161&selection=8,35,10,25|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 161]]

The grasping mind cannot grasp its ungraspability -- *it's building a tolerance for that ungraspability*
- "Negative capability"; tolerance for uncertainty

> Q: If awakening and liberation cannot be attained, then what is meant by the claim that the Buddhas of the past all attained awakening?
> 
> A: From the standpoint of worldly convention and language, they have indeed attained awakening. But from the standpoint of ultimate truth, there is nothing to be attained. 

[[Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself.pdf#page=161&selection=16,0,21,27|Garfield et al._How to Lose Yourself, page 161]]

- There is in a sense something to be attained
- Conversion of being

> As it says in the Scripture on the Teachings of *Vimalakirti*, “Awak- ening is not something that can be attained with either body or mind.” And the Diamond Scripture {Mahayana sutra} says, “There is not the slightest thing to be attained.” **The attainment of all Buddhas lies in their realization that there is nothing to be attained**. Hence, we know that, should you posit a mind, then all exists, but with no mind there is nothing at all.

- Vimalakirti - layperson teacher of non-duality, market story
- Once you don't have S/O structure, you have nothing: no mind
	- Nothing in the sense of no referent
- *We grasp things with concepts* 
	- Buddha uses concepts to teach awakening versus delusion-- conceptualization as tool

>  Q: The Reverend has claimed that everything without exception is without mind. But trees and rocks are also without minds. Surely, you cannot mean that living beings are the same as trees and rocks?

- Trees and rocks are not sentient
	- (Buddhists think of plants as alive but not sentient; Jains think of them as sentient)

>  A: My mind that is without mind is not identical with trees or rocks. Why so? We can compare it to a *celestial drum* that, although it also lacks a mind, spontaneously emits various marvelous teachings that instruct living beings. Or it can be likened to a wish-fulfilling gem that, although it also lacks a mind, is able to spontaneously produce various apparitions. 

(Indian images not org. Chinese)
- "Celestial drum" = cosmic drum that instead of resounding with drum-sounds *resounds with Buddha-teachings*; sutras

- "Wish-fulfilling gem" = gives rise to something which satisfies wish/appearance which appears to satisfy 
- *→ Connects back to Buddha not generating karma*
	- Buddha does not act; nor think
