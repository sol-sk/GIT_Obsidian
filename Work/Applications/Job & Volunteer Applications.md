1. May to July 2025, I worked as a full-time cobbling apprentice at Awl Together Leather. In addition to learning how to repair shoes, I organized their workshop and office and did some customer service. 
   I have also worked freelance as a web designer with MoMA curator Barbara London for her podcast Barbara London Calling, with digital signage company Zignage as an intern, and as a teaching assistant in Philosophy 125 (introduction to scientific reasoning) at UBC. 
   Intermittently since 2018, I have done illustration and painted portrait commissions.

2. I volunteered at the Hatch Art Gallery at UBC in 2023-2024, primarily with university-age students. I was a exhibitions and events coordinator. Exhibition openings and gallery events welcomed all members of the Vancouver community, and were attended by families with young children as well as the elderly. In 2019, I volunteered with Housing Works, a non-profit thrift store dedicated to homelessness in the LGBTQ community and helping those affected by the AIDS crisis.  
3. I completed my Bachelor of Arts degree at UBC in May 2025. My major was in Cognitive Systems, an interdisciplinary program which included computer science, psychology, philosophy, and linguistics. My focus was psychology. I also minored in visual arts. 
4. I love to sew and have been spending much of my free time making clothing recently. I also work with leather, paint, and draw. I am skilled at arts and crafts, especially drawing and painting.
