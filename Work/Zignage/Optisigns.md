### Screens
Connecting the first screen: the Optisigns app can be downloaded and launched on a user PC to use as a test screen. I downloaded the Mac OS app Optisigns Digital Signage and used my computer as the "screen" to push content to. I selected "schedule" as the type.

## Optisigns/ZCast

**Key differences in workflow**
- Optisigns does not offer a layout design workspace; files/media assets are played as is, apps and feeds allow users to use design interfaces they are already comfortable/familiar with to make designs. **EDIT** "Designer", under apps, is Optisigns but it is almost identical to Canva
	![[Pasted image 20251015095609.png]]
	Alerts for unsaved changes
- Because media files go straight into playlists as is to be pushed, it is *very* easy to see what playlists have what media, and to push *straight* from the media page
- *Shared/combined functionality across pages* - Files can be uploaded on playlist page, content can be pushed or added to playlists directly from media page
Single media asset selected: **target** can be set to Screens, tags, or tag rules

## 10.15.25
### Optisigns
IMO for improved workflow: be able to create a new playlist on media page when adding media to playlist
![[Pasted image 20251015094654.png]]
*Easy to apply transition to all* 


**CHANGES AUTOMATICALLY SAVE**


## Full Overview
**Optisigns/ZCast**

- *Assets to live/expire:* A time/season-specific asset can be individually scheduled within the playlist/overall schedule
- *Cross-functionality from media page:* assets can be pushed to screens, added to playlists, and the playlists they are already in can be viewed *from the media page*
- *App compatibility:* Layout design can be done in dozens of different apps and easily imported from the media page. 
- *Scheduling:* Calendar view for schedule, resembling calendar apps like Google Calendar
- *Canva is everywhere:* Templates page is all basic Canva templates, and Optisigns layout "Designer" is also basically Canva. 
- *Playlists:* "Default transition" makes it much easier to create custom playlists; each asset automatically is set to the default transition, which can be changed easily and all assets will update. Indiviudal assets can also be edited to particular transitions. 
- *Layouts = media assets:* There is no distinction made between a "layout" and any other media assets.
- *Interface:* Optisigns feels much more generic, ZCast more "tech-y"
